        "body": "For those that have no idea what I'm talking about, in 2016, a dystopian film called *The Thinning* was released on YouTube Premium (then known as YouTube Red). The film was directed by Michael Gallagher and stars YouTuber Logan Paul (who has been infamous for many controversies) and actress Peyton List.  To keep things short, the film centered around a future where overpopulation has ravaged the world's resources in 2039 and the United Nations begins to require all nations to cut down their populations by 5%. The United States passes a law that requires students to take a test where the lowest scoring students are executed in order to cut down the population. The film's sequel (*The Thinning: New World Order*) focuses more on exposing a hidden plot within the Thinning surrounding the tech corporation Assuru Global while setting up a rebellion against the system as a heated presidential election takes place.  The films had an interesting (although very flawed) concept and some themes surrounding authoritarianism, democratic backsliding, and the pressure that comes when taking school exams (although once again, very flawed and poorly done). There were even some allusions to real-life with the pro-Thinning Texas governor (who is running for election) in the film essentially representing a Trumpian figure that claims to flush away the parasites along with representing some of the political fears of democratic decline in the United States. However, what made the film very flawed was its poor attempt at worldbuilding (since we never see what the United States is like outside of Texas) and its casting choices since this film was meant for YouTube's targeted teenage audience rather than to make a compelling and interesting story.  Both films ended on a cliffhanger with the second one ending with >!many citizens (including the anti-Thinning presidential candidate and the main characters) being arrested in a political purge (similar to the real-life Night of the Long Knives) instigated by the CEO of the tech corporation Assuru Global (who is also the wife of the Texas governor who ran for the presidency).!< A third film is teased with the characters hinting that they are going to war against the government but however, no third film has been released and to this day, people who are fans of the films (which probably consists of teenagers) are demanding for one in the comment sections despite everyone (especially the director Michael Gallagher) moving on to better things (while Logan Paul gets into more controversy).  I'm just wondering on what people's thoughts on them (if anyone remembers at all)."

Featuring an ensemble cast with Jon Hamm, Lewis Pullman, Jeff Bridges, Dakota Johnson, Cynthia Erivo, Cailee Spaeny, and Chris Hemsworth. All of them put in amazing performances. But specifically Erivo and Pullman put in performances that are absolutely breathtaking.  The plot and script is interesting and unique with twists and symbolism so well done it definitely warrants a rewatch. Its direction and cinematography rocks, providing a neo-noir look. And it has a killer soundtrack featuring even a deep purple song.  This is a must watch for anyone who enjoys mystery thrillers. 9/10."

One of the things Rian Johnson mentioned was that bad guys were not allowed to use Apple product placement. Johnson couldn't show his villain using an iPhone in *Knives Out*, although there was a tongue-in-cheek reference to this rule in *Glass Onion*.  The rule seems stupid to me. Lots of villains tend to have expensive, luxurious things. I would fully expect Hans Gruber from *Die Hard* to have a much more expensive stuff than John McClane. Gruber wears an extremely nice suit, and McClane spends most of the movie in a cheap-looking tank top. Its part of McClane's character that he is insecure that his wife's career is much more successful than his own.  I bet some watch company paid a lot of money to get Alan Rickman to wear their watch, and that it turned out to be a sensible marketing decision, because rich people would be very happy to own Hans Gruber's watch.  &#x200B;  Do you think that you would be more, or less willing to buy something that was used by a rich baddie compared to a working-class hero? What if both hero and villain were both expected to have ridiculously expensive and beautiful things? Like in a Bond movie."

        "body": "This is not necessarily movies that came out in 2022, but just the media I've been consuming.  1. Warrior (2010)  Of all the Fighting Movies I've ever seen (including Rocky) this is absolutely the best. Honest brotherly termoil has never been done better and it is the first movie in my adult life to let me cry  2. Rocky/Rambo (1976/1982)  If I thought I was wrong about Jim Carrey, holy cow was I wrong about Sly. He puts in phenomenal performances which carry both movies. I know it was bashed at the time but Rambo's breakdown about the hardships of being a soldier is absolutely brilliant. Rocky surprised me quite a bit by being surprisingly actionless, and fantastic for it (its sequels do not carry this quality). Rocky himself might be one of my favourite protagonists in movie history.  3. Eternal Sunshine/Truman Show (2004/1994)  I somehow haven't seen many Jim Carrey movies. These two were both great though. High concept feel good movies that'd deserve all the praise they get.  4. Burn (2019)  I shouldn't love this movie as much as I do but the story of a lowly robber getting kidnapped by a girl incel is just fun. The location is fantastic as well, love one location films  5. Murder on Orient Express (2017)  I watched a lot of murder mysteries recently, and while Glass Onion, Death On The Nile and See How They Run are all good none of them beat This beautifully picturesque murder mystery.  6. Bullet Train (2022)  This is one of the funniest action movies I've ever seen. Nuf said  7. The Batman/Spiderman No Way Home (2022)  Of the two big comic movies I watched this year, I probably preferred The Batman (I'm a Batman fan, sue me). I did enjoy both though and they both seemed to try harder than a lot of other recent comic movies  8. No Child Of Mine (1997) (technically a mini series but who's counting)  An absolutely heart wrenching story about a young girl repeatedly abused by people who are supposed to protect her which is based on a true story. I bring the plot up because the acting of the lead actress is the greatest piece of child acting I've ever seen and I would highly recommend to anyone looking to go on an emotional journey    9. The Big Sleep (1946)  As far as very old movies, this is the one I watched and loved the most. Still holds up for the dialogue alone. No wonder it was such an inspiration  10. Jungleland (2019)  I think I'm a Charlie Hunnam Stan. This movie was like watching a funeral. Still thought it was great. Also BKB is badass  Also I watched through Snyder's filmography and it was passable"

Holy shit am i sure glad we are somewhat of an obscene family and watch a lot of movies together. There were probably about a total of 25 people in the theater, to begin. About thirty minutes in i ran to the bathroom and as i came out there was a family that had been in the theater with us that decided to leave, it was maybe 3 middle aged women, an older woman, two young children and a middle aged guy. i overhead the oldest woman say “i knew it was gonna be rated R but i had no idea it was going to be that explicit”. okay miss lady why are you bringing kids under the age of 10 to a rated R movie and expecting to to not be explicit? got a good hoot out of me. mind you i'm sure after the split second scene of an elephants asshole opening up really sent them on their way. Went back in the theater and endured the most boobs i have ever seen on christmas. the women sitting in front of me were visibly and audibly grossed out whenever a same-sex kiss was shared on screen and whined to their husbands. The crowds reaction really got me because it was so integral to the experience of the film.   The film itself had me laughing nonstop at some points. it was really crude humor but i like that stuff. the plot was kind of messy and i didn't really like Nellie's character arc just because i felt like we missed so much of it. Tobey's character was fucking horrifying, but he did a great job. the whole sequence in LA's asshole was deeeply disturbing. Manny was an interesting character i just wish that they would have made him less main-character trope-y. Mr. Conrad was a great representation of big star hollywood in my opinion, i think it was somewhat direct satire of leo, johnny, george, that lot. the last thirty minutes of the film felt sooo unnecessary. the climax had already happened and it was just about reiterating a point that films live forever.   overall, there was zero moments of peace in this movie, it's just go go go and everlasting clusterfuck of chaos. although i wasn't bored i can't quite argue that i was entertained. 6/10 wouldn't watch again."

Star Wars Special Editions), or add to an already great story (ex. LoTR).  Never have I seen such a significant quality gap in storytelling between the 2 versions of Kingdom of Heaven.

        "body": "The Edge of Tomorrow (or Live, Die, Repeat) has a plot hole relating to the rules of the movie's time travel and who remembers the details of the previous alternate timeline. A recent discussion on r/movies of major plot holes reminded me of this, and I've never seen it brought up here. Perhaps I'm overthinking a dumb but fun action movie (with an admittedly interesting premise) but it always bothered me.   For those who need a refresher of the plot, the movie revolves around an alien invasion of Earth. The aliens have humanity on the brink of defeat until Tom Cruise's character gains access to the aliens' secret weapon; time-travel. Due to the protagonist getting alien blood in a wound, any time that Tom Cruise's character dies, time rewinds to a set point the prior day. Cruise's character still possess all memory of his prior life, allowing him to reattempt the same challenges with more and more practice. Importantly, no other character is aware of the rewinding of time. In other words, the protagonist effectively has a video game checkpoint with infinite lives.   The plot hole arrives with the introduction of Emily Blunt's character, who like the protagonist, also had the groundhog day-esque checkpoint. I specifically say had, as she claims to have lost her check point ability due to a blood-transfusion she received after a battle.   However, her knowing this information doesn't make any sense. The only way for a character to know if they have this checkpoint is to die, and subsequently experience time-rewinding. So if she lost her ability, she would just die expecting for time to rewind, and then that wouldn't happen. Plus, per the movies rules, she would have no recollection of the previous attempts and rewinds. Later in the film, she even gets frustrated that the protagonist is using his attempts to also try to seduce her, without her knowledge. So to her knowledge, she would believe she still has the ability and wouldn't be weary about blood transfusions (another plot point). Admittedly, I believe the protagonist could inform her that she lost her ability but to my recollection, this isn't done in the film.   Let me know if there is a deleted scene that explains this away or if there are any holes in my logic here. However, this plot hole did somewhat bother me even though Emily Blunt's character obviously also serves to deliver exposition about the movie's universe. I know it's pretty nit-picky, but I thought I'd share regardless.  **TLDR: In Edge of Tomorrow, Emily Blunt's character wouldn't know she lost her checkpoint ability. She would just die with the expectation of respawning.**"

To be honest I wasn't a fan of the first,  your normal 80s action film that was fine but I didn't think it was anything specials.  I really didn't enjoy the romance subplot.  Cut to watching Top Gun Maverick. oh My GOD. What a complete different experience. From 5 minutes in I was hooked and just memorized to what was happening. I enjoyed every god damn second of this movie. I sat there watching the last half hour thinking to myself How did they film these shots?? The dog fight scenes were so tense that I was actually sweating. I know I'm late to the game because this came out a few moths ago and I apologize if this has been talked to death but my god I had to share my experience with someone."

His mother had cancer and was laying in the hospital. I remember him having dreams or visions of his mother being in a hospital on the beach(?) with a crab as a logo for the hospital. I guess that's where he wanted to send his mother to for treatment, but he needed money. For the money he had to kill someone, wich he eventually did.  Also he met a woman he started dating, but they also didn't talk much together on dates. They just spend time together in the cinema or drank a coffee. In the last scene of the movie he was in the cinema and all those people he met in the movie were also there who talked to him (just another vision or dream or whatever i guess)  &#x200B;  Does anyone recognise this movie?

I did not connect or relate to any of the characters as I felt the daughter character went through similar tropes to all girls in coming of age films, (wanting to grow up quicker, desiring romantic intimacy with other people her age, not quite grasping adult issues but knowing they exist) and I feel as if her arc progresses in a predictable manner. More importantly however, I feel as if the dad is a genuinely unlikable character. I hated how petty, childish, and openly resentful he was to having a daughter so young. He did a terrible job hiding his issues with his daughter and instead of better emphasizing with his daughter and making her feel loved, he continued to wallow in his self pity and abandoned her altogether. I read that it's implied that he killed himself but that doesn't make sense to me because I'm sure she would know her dad is dead or at least has disappeared from the face of the earth after that trip. Regardless, I don't feel sympathy for him. I myself struggle with massive depression but I could never walk away from my responsibilities as a parent to a daughter I don't even live with. Oh woe is me you're broke, most parents are! That doesn't give you the right to walk away. And the ending suggesting Sophie understands where her father is coming from is upsetting. He doesn't deserve forgiveness for abandoning a daughter that desperately needed her father's approval. Honestly, I think the biggest issue I had with the film was how formulaic it felt. In no instance did I feel like these events could actually transpire in real life, and it instead felt like some pretentious artsy film a failing NYU grad student would make to boost their grade. I much prefer a movie like the Whale, where all the characters are flawed but have depth and complex reasonings to their actions, that allows you to grow a connection to the characters. As cheesy as that film can be at times, there's an emotional core that's missing from Aftersun.  I understand I'm in the minority here, but I would love to read other's opinions and interpretations so I can better understand what people love about this film."

        "body": "I've just been watching Matilda the Musical on Netflix and thinking how well produced, delightful it is and how wonderfully Tim Minchin-esque the songs are - and I basically thought Roald Dahl probably would have hated this.  Now Dahl is known as a curmudgeonly old git - which would be endearing (and probably why his books are so good and darkly humorous) if it wasn't for the fact he was an anti-semite, which is heartbreaking when his children's books are so funny, touching and generally have an inspiring message - especially Matilda. Anyway, putting this knowledge to one side, I can't help sympathising with the reasons he hates some of his most well-known adaptations of his children's stories.  There's a dark British edge running through his stories. His adult stories, which are unashamedly dark and sinister, were made into Roald Dahl's Tales of the Unexpected (1979-88) which he had a lot of involvement in. They were straight adaptions of his works. So I can see why he would have admired them.  Now his children's stories were totally different kettle of fish.   Willy Wonka & The Chocolate Factory (1971) is a beloved film. It came out at an era when musicals were popular so unsurprisingly it was a musical.  I can understood why Dahl would have hated it. It's not a straight adaption of his work.   It's Americanized - Dahl wanted UK national treasure Spike Milligan to play Wonka, which I think many of his can agree could have been an equally exceptional portrayal as Gene Wilder's take on the character. The title is changed and more emphasis is out on Wonka over Charlie. Plus, Dahl hated the songs which he called saccharine, sappy and sentimental.   Plus, plot changes are made. After Dahl's death, his second wife said: they always want to change a book's storyline. What makes Hollywood think children want the endings changed for a film, when they accept it in a book?  She's got a point.  For him, the film must have felt like a butchering of one of his greatest works.   Now with the 1990 adaption of The Witches, Dahl disliked the film, and regarded it as utterly appalling and although he praised Huston's performance as the Grand High Witch, he was critical of the ending that contrasted with his book. >!This is in reference to the main character, who is turned into a mouse, being turned back into a boy at the end in the film. In the book, he remains a mouse.!<   Now I happen to think this ending ruins one of Dahl's most deliciously dark and haunting endings. It completely revises that tale for probably most of the children who would have experienced it, I can see why he would have gone berserk over it. Plus, it's effectively the film heads telling probably the most respected and popular children's authors of all time that his endings didn't work for children - which leaves a cold taste  in the mouth.  Now one adaption he did apparently like was the animated film The BFG (1989). It's a very straight adaption of his work. The only straight adaption of his lifetime.   He died in 1990. His widow said he would have loved Henry Sellick's James and the Giant Peach (1996) - which I find quite interesting since it instills that dark comical tone of Dahl's writing.  So do we agree?  Does anyone have more stories to tell about Dahl?"

Honestly, Patrick played by Casey Affleck is such an arrogant POS. The whole thing has just triggered me insanely. Let me explain why. *Spoilers alert*  So, Patrick murders a guy - albeit a child abuser - and washes away his internalised guilt and sin by admitting it was wrong and saying he wouldn't do it again. In this case, for Patrick at least, breaking the law is something one should be able to get away with.   Now, this isn't a debate about whether the child abuser should have been able to live or not. Just remember that in Patrick's world, the only right way is his way. Of course, he doesn't turn himself in. Why would he? He apologised to himself and the Lord so he's fine with that.  As the plot develops, it turns out the missing girl is alive and well. She's been taken in a plot by the girl's uncle and the police to remove her from her drug addict mother. Now, Patrick was right - they should have called social services. But they didn't.   Despite Patrick seeing how happy the girl is, how happy the police officer looking after her is (his daughter was killed so this intervention/kidnapping is personal on a deep level of wanting to help the girl) and his girlfriend begging him not to call the authorities - what does ol' Patrick go and do?   Well, in Patrick's mind there even being a slim chance that the girl's drug addict mother can change her ways means they must return the girl. But, let's be honest - in the real world it's wishful thinking. The sensible and rational thing to do would be to leave everything as is and walk away. But not for Patrick, oh no.  The guy who just murdered someone is now oh so holier than thou. He is the arbiter of justice and moral standing. So, taking a huge gamble on the girl's future, he calls the police and that's that. For me, the wild arrogance of this guy is unbearable. To get that far into a movie and see the protagonist turn out to be such a POS is infuriating.   What's even more annoying is that his choice is then validated as the girl's mother goes clean from drugs. But it was a gamble and perfectly encapsulates how he frivolously plays around with people's lives depending on which way the wind blows. Yeah, his girlfriend leaves him - thank god. But, this guy is such an odious douchebag for me at this point I half wanted him to get murdered by one of guys he upset in a bar at the beginning."

I watched it at the age of 13 when it first came out and was disappointed by it not being a cold war era Bourne Identity movie since Matt Damon is the protagonist.   Anyway, I watched I again recently on Hulu and I actually loved it this time around. The music, cinematography, writing and acting were all fantastic. I'll admit that the movie is not for everyone. However, if you enjoy the slow burner type of movie with a penchant for the period then you'll enjoy the movie too.  What are some movies that you really liked but got shat on by critics?"

I was a kid when MiB first aired and I can definitely say that, while it is an old movie, it holds up pretty well nowadays. It may be nostalgia, but I remember loving this one along with Jurassic Park, independence Day and heck Space Jam?   I had, however, never watched 2 and 3. I remember 2 being pretty hyped up and talked about but never actually had the time to catch it. It's ehm a pretty weird movie, feels very much like something more for the kids rather than for everyone, I didn't like it honestly, Will's rap at the end was pretty solid though.  I wanted to talk about 3 though. I found it really good? i was expecting stuff to just get worse from 2 on out but if 1 is an 8 and 2 is a 5.5-6 I'd say 3 is a solid 7-7.5 imo. I was wondering why no one talks about this movie?  As for International, well I'm in the middle of watching it and wanted to write this while stuff was still fresh in my mind. MiBI is weird, I had a feeling it was going to be so when I first saw that they switched the penis guns for a more human designed gun. In so far it's really bland. Hope it didn't kill the franchise. MiBI could be a really cool tv series concept. Following other agents from around the globe kind of like the kids show.  Anyway what do you guys think about this franchise?"

I feel like the characters and their relationships in The Irishman are better than the ones in Goodfellas, and the story is much more emotionally potent. I know the length is an issue with a lot of people, but I actually liked how long it was. It helped flesh out the characters and their relationships. It is fitting for a story where you're following a character over decades of his life because by the end it genuinely feels like it, and it makes the ending of the film more powerful. My main complaint with the Irishman would be that the cgi isn't always perfect, and that in the scenes where Robert De Niro is supposed to be younger you can tell he is an older man (I think most people will know what specific scene I'm thinking of). However I think the story would not have been as powerful if they had different actors play the characters in their younger years, so those problems are worth it.   Part of the reason why I prefer The Irishman may be due to the fact that I saw the Irishman before I saw Goodfellas. I don't wanna say that the reason people prefer Goodfellas is due to nostalgia (though I feel like that plays a role), but due to the similarity in subject matter of the films I feel like you may resonate more with the one you saw first. I'm curious to see why people prefer Goodfellas, and also if anyone else feels the way I do."

This film is amazing!!! Janelle Monáe 10/10."

I know review bombing and stuff is a problem but I would much prefer they just provide filters to let you filter the content rather than manipulate reviews with no transparency.

What does everyone here think? Asking since, I feel like when people ask for movies similar to The Godfather, people recommend modern crime movies, rather than historical dramas/epics."

We are talking about one of the best slapstick movies ever made, it should be there with the Airplane, Naked gun and many other classics, but for some reason people seem to over see the genious pure popcorn hilarity, that is the Clue!  Don't forget Rush Hour 2! This movie is one of the best buddy cop movies ever made. A perfect blend of cool action and funny dialogue, never forgetting the amazing chemistry between Chrish Tucker and Jackie Chan, but it only has 51% on rotten tomatoes, and critics elsewhere don't seem to get its beauty.  Movies aren't only about the depth of the characters or the performance, they are mostly about the feeling they generate on the viewer. This is something that the critics often forget. These two movies offer you an hour and a half that you'll never forget! They will take you on a ride that is most of all goofy, but in retrospect something very, very valluable... they made you forget your real life and took you into a world much like yours, but somehow different -as in a dream- and made you laugh and giggle like a schoolboy.  You could watch thousands of 12 years a slave, gravity, spotlight etc. But never arrvive to the same serenity as when watching something that is just FUN and GOOFY! (i love those movies tho, except gravity...)  That being said... i hated her so much! It...it... flame? Flames? Flames! On the side of my face!"

We watched it a couple of days ago and something dawned on me. I asked him “so when someone says something like “yeah it's like Groundhog Day,” what do you think that means?”   He said “I have no idea what that means.” Which is somehow hilarious to me bc it's such a common expression for every day feeling the same or a repetitive experience. And I know I've said it to him in the past and probably other people have too, and like what did he think it meant?!  Anyway, it got me thinking—what are some other common expressions/references from movies that may whoosh over others' heads if they aren't familiar with the movie?  ETA: so it seems like there's different categories of things going on in the comments and I'm trying to parse out what separates what I'm asking about from oft-quoted movies.   - I'm starting to think the expression almost has to contain part or all of the title of the movie.  - The expression would be meaningless (or mean something completely different) without the existence of the movie. - the expression basically uses the movie to apply a label to a concept? This might be too specific, not sure.   Some good examples from the comments: - Calling someone a “stepford wife” (yes, source material is a book but I would say it's the case with most movies and I doubt people were using this phrase as commonly before the movie(s)) - adding “ception” to the end of any word when you're talking about a thing within a thing (even though it was correctly pointed out, that's not really what inception means in the movie 😂)  The Bucket List is good too, but a little different to me. I had no idea that the 2007 movie was the origination of the phrase! I never saw the movie but absolutely know what it means and do not associate the phrase with a movie. Because the title itself is a literal common expression and the meaning of the expression comes from the words in the title. Whereas Groundhog Day and Stepford wife don't give much to go on as far as interpreting the meaning unless you saw the movie."

The cinematography is definitely unmatched, and making it black and white left the movie with an incomparable atmosphere.

        "body": "Not necessarily which movies are technically “the best”, but the ones you enjoyed the most.  For me the list would be:  - The Menu  Probably the best fictional single-handed takedown of an entire industry I've ever seen put to screen, and also one of the most interesting entries in the now-popular “class warfare” genre. There are no heroes in this movie, and it's all the better for it. Ralph Fiennes is fiendish as a villainous chef, and his idiot customers provide a generous helping of comic relief to what would otherwise be a quite dark movie.  - Bullet Train  Dumb action made smart, with a meticulously planned clockwork plot and one of the best ensemble casts of the year. Joey King once again proves how underrated she is as she plays a hatable villain with ease, and the celebrity cameos are impeccable. This is a movie that demands to be rewatched over and over, with the promise of finding a new, fun detail in it every time.  - The Whale  A powerful movie about trying to do the right thing and doing the exact wrong thing in the process. Darren Aronofsky manages to create an Uncut Gems level of anxiety inside a single, tiny apartment. A lot has been said about Brendan Fraser's stellar performance, but all the other main actors are just as stunning.  - Guillermo Del Toro's Pinocchio  The best animated film in a very, very, VERY long time. Del Toro outdoes every other version of the classic story by leagues as he makes bold, ridiculous changes to the text that would be laughed off in anyone else's hands but become transcendent within his, complicating the story's moral fabric and giving it new life.   - All Quiet On The Western Front  This film wants to make you angry, and it succeeds in spades. The pain and random death of ordinary soldiers on the front lines of WWI, history's most stupid, useless war, is brilliantly contrasted with the thumb-twiddling negotiations of privileged generals and diplomats more concerned with screwing each other over than ending the suffering.   - Nope  Jordan Peele returns in force with a meditation on the pursuit of fame and its consequences that's one part sci-fi, one part horror, and one part Greater L.A. legend. Steven Yeun steals the show with an unforgettable supporting arc that may be even more compelling than the main story.  - Elvis  Just like its namesake, this spot-on biopic is gaudy, theatrical, and full of thematic contradictions. Austin Butler gives a performance for the ages as he probes deep into The King's psyche to explore the vision that motivated him and the glaring flaws that led to his downfall. The film seems to never exhaust its supply of clever ways to underscore the sheer scope of Elvis's legacy, even as we see the man himself doubt it.  - Turning Red  One of the few big risks Pixar has taken in recent years, this film pays off. It's been a long time since Disney animated movies have had anything new to say about family relationships, but a transition of focus to the more strictly ordered structure of traditional Asian families allows director Domee Shi to explore interesting ideas about what parents and children owe to each other, and what they can learn from one another.  - The Batman  There have been many iterations of Batman over the years, but Matt Reeves gives us a new one: a Batman who's just plain wrong sometimes. As Robert Pattinson's Bruce Wayne tracks down Paul Dano's cleverly modernized Riddler (now an anti-government terrorist doing active recruitment on Reddit), he's forced to confront the numerous similarities between himself and the villains he fights. This may be the only movie ever where Batman decides to change for the better near the end, and that's not a bad thing in our broken age.  - X  Ti West gleefully takes a chainsaw to the erotic thriller in a movie so lowbrow that it's impossible to explain how it's still somehow high art to someone who's never seen it. Mia Goth excels in a dual role as a young, pretty woman and an old, homely one whose twisted obsession with the former drives the film's plot. The supporting cast is just fun, with Kid Cudi, Jenna Ortega, and more getting picked off one by one in a southern gothic-horror equivalent to “Home Alone”.   So there's my picks. All in all this was an incredible year in film, and I'm excited to see different movies pop up on everyone's list."

As I've gotten older, though, I've gained a major appreciation for it. So much so that I felt the need to post this.   I know it's not exactly a hot take to say this, but the movie is very well done and is such a nice, feels good, Christmas movie.   As a kid, the constant narration, 40s time frame, and slow pace put me off. I couldn't understand why mom and dad played it every year. Why watch that when we could watch Jim Carrey's Grinch? I'm sure I often thought. Now, though, as a 23 year old, I get it (I have for the past few years but just now making the post). The older I get, the more I appreciate more of the movie.   This year was the first year I really thought about how sweet it is that Alfie's dad bought him the bb gun. The joy and excitement on the dads face when Alfie is going to the present looks so real. All movie, everyone told Alfie he didn't need the gun and that he'd shoot his eye out, but that didn't stop the dad. He wanted to see his kid's face light up on Christmas.   The movie is FULL of memorable and quotable moments. Between You'll shoot your eye out, Fra-gee-lay, and fa ra Ra Ra Ra you'll surely get some laughter or feels out of it. I've even gotten to where I appreciate the narration style storytelling.   The movie is just chock full of Christmas good time moments and is truly a Christmas classic.  Edit: lmao I literally just watched the damn thing and already forgot the kids name. Ralphie 🤦🤦"

It wasn't really groundbreaking in terms of visuals for its time, but what captivated me the most about this movie was how beautifully the plot unveiled as an emotional rollercoaster. You've got Roger with his Pongo who meets and later marries Anita who's got her Perdita, then Pongo and Perdita themselves form a love union. Then you have the antagonist Cruella, who by the way is so explicitly well portrayed, who's the polar opposite of the protagonists, that creates this incredible good vs. evil story. The comedy, the funny dialogue, the soundtrack, and of course the voices are some other reasons why I like this version of the movie the best.      To preface, I've seen the live action movie from 1996 and quite frankly it didn't capture the same vibes as the original. I could be biased, but it seemed more watered down, almost as if Disney were forcing it to be more children appealing. Idk, do you agree? If no, why?"

The deaths are outstanding and the twist ending I thought was very well done. I do think the direction lagged a bit.

Think about it: Christmas Vacation, The Santa Claus movies, the aforementioned ABMC, Home Alone. A Christmas Story is set in nearby northern Indiana. Even Planes, Trains, and Automobiles (though its a Thanksgiving movie). I'm sure there are others I'm forgetting.   Is it because Chicago is (arguably) the most well known US city that's neither LA or NY? Because it's guaranteed to have snow at Christmas? Or something else I'm missing?"

I got it that the basic idea was that Jang supporting Song in keeping her murder as a secret was seen by her as a sign that Jang loved her. But I was wondering whether the theme of not understanding or even misunderstanding each other (portrayed through the language barrier) also played a role in this. Just think of the scene with the cat, where Jang (or rather the transcription of his recording) misinterpreted 'heart' as 'head'. Could it be that the Korean voice message, especially the passage Song keeps skipping to, has also a similarity to something that expresses love in Chinese? If not literally, then maybe allegorically or regarding the imagery? For me, this topic of misunderstanding / the troubles of communication are so omnipresent in this movie that I was sure it had to be in this scene somewhere, too, but sadly I neither speak Korean nor Chinese, so I can't really look at the text itself."

I'm not bashing either both are amazing just felt it was interesting the duality of two successful filmmakers.  Edit: I should've worded this better and not like it's a fact and exactly how their filmmaking and philosophy is. I mainly wanted to see what the users here thought of it and discussion around it. I watch a lot of movies but will not pretend to understand many, if any, of the different factors they are considering in the process of creation. Also my favorite movies from both of them are Memento and Aliens.  Edit2: I'm also not trying to imply that fans of James are inherently dumber or Nolan fans are pseudo-intellectuals.  Edit3: I've read a lot of these and they've swayed my opinion on this a lot. I initially hadn't considered just how much Nolan spends on explaining the concepts as him treating the audience as stupid and I agree that would go against my initial post. I was originally considering the fact that he does use concepts that need such long explanations to flesh out as him overestimating the audiences intelligence to follow his lead, which could just be chalked up to a flaw in his writing. And to clarify I know Cameron doesn't shy away from complex themes either like colonialism and environmentalism it's just in my mind more accessible for people to understand than the references Nolan is going for that have to be outright taught - Cameron doesn't have to be as heavy handed with explanations and the movie is still enjoyable and digestible if you don't understand something or miss it.   Seems the main thing people here have been able to agree on is instead Nolan overestimates his own intelligence.   Also I forgot Nolan did the Dark Knight series I know that doesn't fit my original post at all!"

I have yet to see a funnier Christmas film than Bad Santa. Billy Bob Thornton, Tony Cox and Bernie Mac were superb in this film and so was Terry Zwigoff, the director. I think the kid was very good as well but the true Superstar of the film was John Ritter who has never funnier than in this film and I don't say it lightly. John Ritter is so good that I started laughing even when appeared on the screen after first 2 scenes.  I highly recommend either or both of these films to watch every Christmas depending on how you are feeling and who you are with."

Allowing each moment to breath, there is a sense of naturalness that can be seen with the development of the characters.   Coming to the cinematography, the movie brilliantly uses the colour pallete to showcase the landscape beautifully. The zooming-in of the camera, and the shots from a distant angle, makes the movie look vivid. The animation was also top-notch and the weather perfectly reflects the tone of the movie. When things get dark and depressing, the saturation of the movie changes, and gives it a dull and gloomy feeling, while when the main characters are having the time of their life, the landscape is bright and vivid, perfectly mirroring the emotions of the character"

        "body": "It's been a few weeks since I've seen this so I'm a little hazy on some parts but I firmly believe that in Matilda The Musical 2022, Matilda dies (is in a coma for some of it.) Here are my thoughts.  Early in the film her father says he told Trunchbull to give her harsher punishment. understandably most parents would not allow this but a parent saying she can go extra harsh, means she can go extra brutal.  Throughout the film she doesnt develop her powers until after her encounter with the Trunchbull. (Where she is exploding bombs or mines.)  We know that Matilda loves reading and is very creative in her stories.  There is a lasting memory of Bruce trying to move a can with his mind, we know that Matilda uses her experiences in her story that she tells to the librarian.  When we see her in the clouds she talks about people not being able to reach her and I think there was something else.  Throughout the film we see bits that state something like it's not always a happy ending.  Metaphorically, the chains that bind Trunchbull at the end are the police, but she somehow gets away, maybe saying she evaded the law?  The chokey resembles a coffin in the middle of nowhere that Matilda breaks like she is fighting death? At the end she reveals plenty more like she had a plan to kill all of the children, but Matilda's story shows how she stops her and destroys them all, like the consequence of her death mesnt she went too far this time and there was an investigstion.  At the end of the film she releases the glue from her fathers hst, like she has finally let go.  I think there were a few more things but i cant for the life of me remember. Its released tomorrow on Netflix so if you give it a watch again let me know what you think.  All in all I loved the film and I think if this theory was intentional, its a masteroiece if story-telling.  My daughter can't wait to watch it again tomorrow. But I don't think I can tell her my thoughts on this, it'll ruin the magic! My wife thought I was stupid until I explained it all."

The composer that is considered as the father of all movie songs(at least for most people) is john willians. Probably because he was the one who revolutionized the cinema history by founding the genre 'space opera' together with George Lucas. However, there are musicians who made exceptional jobs like howard shore or hans zimmer(this one is probably the closest to the geniality of willians) that for some people are more remarkable than willians.  For me, something that really has a big weight on forming this kind of opinion is the nostalgia relationed to the movie at the time the person watched it(like childhood or teenage years).

We know she's in the house alone with Billy (the killer) and it's strongly implied that he goes downstairs at the end of the film, potentially murders Jess, and makes one more phone call, however, Jess's fate is left intentionally ambiguous. Upon multiple rewatches I think the film leans into the idea that Billy murders Jess since he makes a phone call after every kill, but nonetheless it's still left up to interpretation.  Personally I like to think that Jess somehow survived or wasn't attacked by Billy - it could be the way the last scene is edited but it seems like there's way too little time between Billy's descent from the attic and his phone call for him to kill Jess and get to the phone. Also, it's pretty well established that Billy is severely mentally unstable, but it seems odd even for him that he'd call the house after killing Jess knowing it was empty and that no one would pick up, except for maybe the policeman outside?  I think its because the film wants us to sympathize with Jess that I want her to survive, but I still can't make up my mind as to what happens. So what do you think - does Jess survive or is she ultimately another one of Billy's victims? Would love to hear your thoughts about the ending as well as some of the films other ambiguities!

While I understood why all those movies were considered disturbing in their own ways, none of them really ever gave me that sense of “wtf” that you feel deep in your gut when something really disturbing genuinely effects you.   Well, let me tell you, that all changed today when I watched Threads.   It is a film depicting a nuclear apocalypse in British and the aftermaths of it and I have never seen such a disturbing film. It gave me that guy feeling. It's one of those films where, after it was over, I had to just sit in silence for like 10 minutes to just to take it all in and process it.  More importantly than it just being incredibly disturbing and effecting, is that it is GENUINELY aa fantastic movie. I feel like a lot of times when people suggest a movie they consider “disturbing,” it will be a film that relies on shock factor. I've seen a lot of disturbing movies that completely neglect storyline and artistry in lieu of just trying to make the viewer “uncomfortable.” This usually takes away from the emotional effectiveness for me.  When I say “disturbing” or “unsettling,” I mean I want a film I feel like I HAVE to sit with afterwards because it effected me so deeply. Threads is this movie for me.   So if you are like me and are looking for a movie that is not only genuinely disturbing, but also fantastically directed with a unique, enthralling storyline: watch Threads"

At this time, they are played on tv every year and discussed among friends, family, and co-workers. Growing up I saw, Four Christmases, Deck the Halls, and Christmas With the Kranks hit theaters.  Now, I look at the last few years and think about a much-talked about, memorable, Christmas movie hasn't been released or promoted to my knowledge. The year, 2015,  gave me hope with The Night Before and Love the Coopers.  Since then though, the last one we got seems to be Last Christmas which was actually good, but I don't know if it is as well-known like it should be.  My point is that we always retell our Christmas movie stories, but there doesn't seem to be any ones made as of late to continue those memories. A Christmas Story Christmas could have been one, because it was a sequel to a classic. Instead, it was on Peacock.  I see Hallmark and other networks producing new holiday movies, but have the studios done so as of late theatrically? Do you expect there to be another good Christmas movie sometime in the future?"

Margot Kidder is awesome.   It's one of my favorite horror movies, and features IMHO one of the most haunting end credit scene of all time.

They get into a car, not sure what happens in between but I remember as far as the woman looking into the rear view mirror at the boy to find him holding the eyeball, she makes contact with it and runs into a tree.... not sure if she dies.

In my memory, all the Santas were running around in one scene, possibly indoors, getting in each other's way like soke crazy farce.

A movie like Fight Club criticizes Toxic-Masculine culture but it's message is easily missed because the film does bring up legitimate issues that men (and women) still face today such as what it's like to live in a society under Late Stage Capitalism. While your not meant to agree with the points Tyler spouts, I feel it would have been a little more powerful if the film gave the Narrator an alternative path that he could have gone, but I understand that was not the point.  I saw a post here recently on movies who's subtlety messages are either ignore or not considered by audiences, like Robocop's pro Union and Anti-Capitalist message or It's a Wonderful Life's Socialist message and It made me remember how hard trying to convey a message that people will understand without being as transparent and in your face about it. Doing that would have the film be branded as propaganda by some. I always support film-makers not holding back in their messages but I know many would disagree with me.   How can a filmmaker convey a message in their movies without being accused of making propaganda?  I know many go to films for escape but films (and media in general) believe it or not has been a huge influence in how we progressed as a society so I understand why filmmakers always have a message they to put out there that could spark change."

But it is not perfect and I feel it loses some of the best bits from it's source material.  I don't want to sound too condescending but most people do not understand what truly makes a film anti-war. I personally don't even always understand, or even often understand. That said, I'm tired of seeing every new war movie get labeled as anti-war basically immediately- because it is horrific and harrowing.  Anti-war is not the same thing as “War bad,” everyone knows war is bad, but yet it still happens every day. A True anti-war film IMO gets to the heart of the human condition to discuss and deconstruct what makes us tick, what makes us violent, whether violence is inevitable, etc. As a filmmaker though, you really can't just say war is bad, it's like saying rape is bad and acting all smug and smart about it (cough cough Irreversible cough cough).  Anyways, All Quiet (2022) is a fine movie but a failure as an anti-war piece, and IMO big letdown to the source material.  What are some movies you feel truly convey an Anti-War narrative, not just War is Bad."

The entire final act's drama could've been avoided ENTIRELY if Betty had literally just said what was bothering her when she confronted Bob at the piano. Then Bob could've said Nope. None of that's true. and moved right on. Instead, she refuses to discuss literally anything with him, cold-shouldering him not once but twice before she finally realizes what was overheard was taken out of context entirely.   Also, it's a good example of minding your own business. If Emma was immediately called out for her eavesdropping instead of people just thinking it's harmless literally NOTHING bad would've happened in the entire movie. In a way, the entire drama of the final act is her fault, completely.   Thank you for coming to my rant. Enjoy your holidays, everyone!"

How Scar is introduced playing with a helpless mouse he is about to devour while skipping out on his nephew's birth ceremony. When Zazu reprimands Scar (causing him to lose the mouse) he immediately tries to eat Zazu. Already, we know that this guy is Bad News.  Or Aladdin shows himself to not only be an affable thief, but a guy who's soft enough to give his stolen food away to a pair of homeless children without a second thought. The One Jump Ahead song tells you absolutely everything you need to know about the guy in a catchy two-minute package. The later reprise after giving away the bread also reveals his more vulnerable side and that being called a street rat really does bother him, and this insecurity eventually leads to further conflict in the movie."

I love Christmas movies so I'll name some that are family favorites in my house.   Scrooge (1970) - this is a classic version of A Christmas Carol with original songs. This production benefits from lots of talent carried over from 1968's Oliver! Another classic musical. Not much to say about this one other than it's my family's classic version of A Christmas Carol, it's paint by the numbers, but has good acting and some fun songs.   Arthur Christmas - I have no idea how many people remember this extremely cute movie from 2011 but I adore it. It has trappings of a classic kids Christmas movie where you might expect an evil real estate man trying to destroy Christmas, but no! Nothing like that. In fact I don't know if you could find a Christmas movie where the stakes are lower! In the first 15 minutes of the movie Christmas goes off without a hitch, all the presents delivered, Santa's job is done! Only wait, one child was missed. Just one. What follows is a truly deep dive in my opinion about how the biggest enemy of Christmas isn't an evil cartoon villain, it's forgetting that Christmas isn't about your petty arguments or the glory of who gets to be Santa, or what methods are best, it's about the joy the person you give a gift has.  It's a subtle reminder not to make the holidays about yourself, make it about those you care about.   Klaus 2019 - on Netflix, a surprisingly good and as far as I know completely original new origin for Santa. It got lots of awards, you very well have heard of it, but if you haven't, definitely give it a try.   Spirited 2022 - I doubt this is a hidden gem, but it's new, and I've already watched it 4 times this year lol. Ryan Reynolds and Will Ferrell star in yet another Christmas Carol adaptation, also a musical, with a few really awesome numbers that involve huge casts of dancers. Even if you're tired of A Christmas Carole, I highly recommend checking this one out as it will surprise you a bit here and there as the ghosts find this Christmas goes off the rails a bit. It's on Apple + only I think.   What's your holiday recommendations? Have you seen any of mine?"

The plot is also fascinating: Keanu playing a lawyer who knows his clients are guilty, and yet defending them anyways, unaware of the impending consequences of his actions.   It all leads up to the final showdown of Kevin Lomax and John Milton, and man is it spectacular; Pacino goes more Pacino than any of his other roles. But it loses me towards the end, when Lomax kills himself in the altar(?) which leads to the end of Milton and his half-sister too. Except, it was a different reality all along, as the film foreshadows in the beginning. So Lomax, who arguably is more evil than Milton, gets a second chance. He doesn't have to live with the terrible things he did.  It just wasn't a satisfying ending to me. Here's my alternate ending: Lomax is offered the choice by Milton to inherit the legal empire in exchange for giving him children. Still grieving over Mary Ann's suicide and the reporter's revelation before he was ran over, he decides to go back to Gainesville with his mother and become a good lawyer. Not a happy ending because of his consequences, but he still finds some redemption.   If it weren't for the ending we got, I think The Devil's Advocate could have become a cult classic, even a critically acclaimed film."

I'm sure many of you think I must be crazy or have terrible taste in movies, but let me tell you some of the reasons I love this movie.   I'm a bigger fan of the Resident Evil movie franchise than the game series, having only played a few titles. So I am not bothered by characters not being portrayed like they are in the games, but I'm familiar enough to recognize character names.   This RE entry is directed by Paul W.S. Anderson, his return to the franchise, having directed the 1st but not the 2nd & 3rd. The movie was filmed using 3D cameras, not converted to 3D in post, making for an enjoyable experience for 3D fans. FYI, if you have an Oculus Quest 2, this can be watched in 3D via Vudu.   First, excellent opening sequence with a great soundtrack. Followed by the assault on the Umbrella Tokyo facility by multiple Alices, which is something I just love. The image of over a dozen black clad Alices running around with sub machine guns is one of the best in the series. Great action, especially in 3D, with a very cool depiction of Wesker introduced who spouts ridiculous lines perfectly (“…and I want damage reports”).   The shift from Tokyo to a desolate Pacific North West, then to a zombie filled Los Angeles, provides a good balance and shift in tone. The prison is a perfect setting for a zombie apocalypse scenario.    I'm not a fan of Ali Lartner, but she is okay in this. Wentworth Miller, Kim Coates, Boris Kodjoe and (again) Shawn Roberts as Wesker are fun.  Other highlights include Alice's quarters, the Axeman shower fight, and using A Perfect Circle for the closing sequence.  This is a fun movie that I definitely recommend, especially in 3D."

Where as in the previous films ships had engines , looked dirty and weren't so clean cut. Everything just looks way too shiny and unused. The princesses ship especially looks badly designed.   Also some scenes simply look incredibly cartoony. The battle on naboo looks terrible. All the lighting looks so unrealistic. Something CGI still struggles with today.   These were bad films when they came out and they're just as bad now. They don't continue on the star wars universe that was established in the previous trilogy.   That's my take."

Cities, especially, can create a powerful form of this kind of saudade.  So, what film or show's portrayal of a city would you consider particularly memorable?  P.S. Please be specific. 'Gotham', for example, has been the primary setting of all the versions of Batman, but for me *The Animated Series* Gotham is the one I have the most powerful sense of being 'Gotham'.

I have watched and loved every single one of his movies and they never fail to impress me. Obviously, some are closer to my heart than others but his mastery of the craft and visual inventiveness was always there. To the point where I would always say to everyone: “There's no such thing as a bad Spielberg movie”. Now on to the subject of this posting:  “The Fabelmans” is clearly Spielberg's most personal film as its subject is his childhood, his family moving from New Jersey to Arizona and finally to California to follow his father's successful engineering career. The story is a rather bland straight forward recounting of his parents mariage difficulties and young Spielberg's nascent love of cinema and the craft of making movies. However, The Fabelmans is also Spielberg's most disappointing  movie. It is the least interesting, the least inventive and worst; his least cinematic.  And so, it is with sadness that I have now to admit that there is indeed such a thing as a bad Spielberg movie.  Even a genius moviemaker like Spielberg couldn't disprove the old adage that «Talent is a curve »."

There's a certain scene that I knew about beforehand that I really did not want to watch, and if you've seen the film, you know which scene I'm referring to. But I finally worked up the nerve to watch it and aside for that scene, I overall really liked the film. The cast was amazing, the story was really engaging, and the cinematography was pretty good. I'm a huge fan of Nine Inch Nails so I was really looking forward to the score, and it did not disappoint. Trent and Atticus are at the top of my favorite film composers list and did an amazing job with the score. The only problem I really had with the film, aside from that certain scene, was that there is another storyline with Daniel Craig's character that did not interest me as much as the main storyline. The last thing I'll say is that if your feeling depressed, or anything like that, I don't recommend this film because, I don't know about anyone else, but I've pretty much lost my faith in humanity, because you know there are people in real life who are as evil and despicable as certain characters in this film."

        "body": "Looking at film history, a lot of movies get released in 'cycles'. e.g. in the 60's you had historical epics and then westerns. Then in the 1970's you had the new wave. And in the 80s and 90s, you had a host of popular genres like thrillers, sci-fi, action, and so on. In 2000, Gladiator and LOTR enjoyed success and briefly revived the historical/fantasy epic genre.  Almost always, you have a movie or movies that cause the cycle to begin in the first place. Then you have some film(s) failing and therefore ending that genre's domination. e.g. films like Heaven's Gate and One from the Heart led to the demise of the Hollywood new wave.  Currently superhero fanchises (Marvel, DC, and so on) dominate the box office (at least in Hollywood) and seem to be doing pretty well. But at some point, there has to be a film that hypothetically fails and beings an end to this cycle.  What do you think will be the next genre to dominate the box office? And Why?  Feel free to discuss.  EDIT: Personally, I hope the historical/war movie genre will make a comeback someday, but that's probably just wishful thinking (Scott's Napoleon and the Cleopatra remake with Gal Gadot are about to be released/filmed, but whether they're actually successful is another matter).  Apart from that, it would also be great if someone made a western with a large, epic scope like Heaven's Gate (most westerns these days seem to focus on a smaller scope in general)."

He gave her full control of the editing process and she changed the films bc of it, but nobody knows that bc she was a woman. Not only that, but it is recorded that she often decided filming locations and what subjects to film. Being a female director, this is directing.  Years later, this woman would film content that would help take down Nazis in the Nuremberg trials.   Her directorial debut was actually crafted from existing footage that Vertov used for that one famous film everyone knows him for... Man with a camera I think.  Her stuff is incredibly hard to find on the internet. Does anyone share an interest in witnessing the pioneering film talent of this woman who has been erased from history and not given the credit she deserves?

There's no doubt that other companies and franchises will jump on this boat. However even with Mario and sonic, I still feel like even in 10 years they might still be hit or miss.  As for the other option, multiverse movies have a lot of potential and story telling and its honestly my favourite genre in any media.

Some of it's left out or shifted around a bit, but it is so incredibly true to the source material.  Depp and Del Torro spent months with Thompson doing drugs so they could portray every scene as accurately as possible. Apparently when they did a pre-screening with Hunter he had literal flashbacks during the opening bat scene and he flipped out.  It's also just the pinnacle of iconic drug movies, maybe besides Up In Smoke. Also great to watch on drugs, the camera-work is great. It doesn't compare to the trippy modern CGI you might see in something like Dr. Strange, but they did a fantastic job for mid-90's tech."

The historical pieces of the movie were decent, but i found myself not being able to connect with the characters at all because of how little development was available.  There's a few scenes of the friends talking about how exciting the war is going to be, a morale speech by their recruiters / commanders, the actual march to the battlefield, then they all die quickly, and the MC is left with himself and few others. The most emotionally stressful scenes were that of people dying, a few that the main character had little to no connection to, and from then on the film really just drags.

A film about such a monotonous subject that is filled to the brim with the youthful conquer-the-world college energy, Sorkin's career best dialogue, beautifully shot and edited in the classic David Fincher fashion, with pitch-perfect casting and performances in a story as old as time: a story of betrayal, theft, ambition and isolation. All relatively based on a true story about the creation of one of the most widely influential and impactful companies in history.  Now, just take a look at what has happened to Mark Zuckerberg and the company since then. This is not a political post, so I'm not sharing an opinion on these, just acknowledging they're things they've had to deal with since 2010 : their role in the Arab Spring, first billion users, Russian election interference/Cambridge Analytica, testifying before Congress, accusations of supporting propaganda involved in genocide, a trillion dollar valuation, rebranding, Metaverse, and possibly a rumored resignation. There is another compelling story about our times to be told in there somewhere.   And another Fincher/Sorkin/Eisenberg would be sure to match much of the key quality of the original. So that instead of getting ripped off the Oscar (you can like The Kings Speech all you want, you won't convince me that it's even remotely a better movie), the Academy can right this wrong. An error that I think has becoming increasingly acknowledged since then, and could also give Fincher an opportunity to finally get his due with an Oscar given his really incredible career"

They have no idea how the characters are going to look, and they need to imagine the entire scenery.  Robin Williams as the Genie in Aladdin (1992), I think comes very close to being the GOAT next to Mel Blanc!! Not only did he manage to give the character so much energy using his voice, he also gave quite an emotional performance when it came to moments that were serious, and most of his lines were ad-libbed.  I also think James Woods as Hades in Hercules (1997) Mark Hamill as the Joker in Batman and Steve Carrell as Hammy in Over the Hedge (2006) are right behind him!"

Se7en, The Dark Knight, Chinatown, Prisoners, etc.  But we've all come across a movie, video game, comic book, etc. that just felt so needlessly dark, that it feels over-the-top or almost a parody of itself. This is what most people would call “edgy.”  What movie or movies have you guys seen that you'd best describe as edgy?  I think some noteworthy examples could be the entire Human Centipede franchise, the insanely horrible A Serbian Film, and (depending on who you ask) anything by Lars Von Trier. Anything else along those lines?  Edit: Well shit, seems like “edgy” is an insanely subjective term. Donnie Darko's been mentioned like 30 times and so have Fight Club and American Psycho. Interesting.  Edit 2: Dear God, some of you have replied quite possibly the dumbest things I've ever read on this site"

Instead I got what I can only describe as an alien's best attempt at making a Jewish movie. This movie was like someone took For Your consideration's Home for Purim seriously and tried to make it, only during channukah. I would call the movie a shonda (disgrace) but there has to be a modicum of Jewishness to earn that title.   First, almost every Jewish character was blond but more importantly they were boring af. Their complaining and nagging was endearing, not soul shattering like real Jewish grandparents. The story was about latkes but everyone knows that Hanukkah is really about jelly donuts and latkes are just an appetizer.   The kicker is that the two Jewish love interests bond over pennies that they find and pick up off the ground. It's like a Protestant from middle America was asked to write a movie about Jews and this is what he came up with.   10/10 highly recommended (a few drinks is a must)"

The acting and the story were actually pretty good too. The characters were more developed than a typical action movie and I was genuinely surprised in some of the directions the story took. Usually you can predict the plot of an action movie.   Sure there was quite a bit of cheese but that's to be expected. You can only do so much being stuck in one interior location, but I think they really got their mileage out of it (ha!) I also read they shot over COVID so they had to do it all on a sound stage which is even more impressive.   Anyone else like this film?

The conversation at the dinner table between Tess and Danny feels ripped from some old school Cary Grant shit. It's amazing. Not to mention the editing and pacing of the movie, it's more entertaining than the majority of movies I've seen the last few years.  The sequels are definitely a dip on form, they keep the cast chemistry and brilliant soundtracks but they really lose an element the first film had. I'm assuming this is because the screenwriter of 11 was not involved with the other two and the banter is definitely lacking in the sequels compared to original.

Like I get that a lot of times the rape of whatever character is crucial for the events of the movie (last house on the left events wouldn't have happened if the rape never occurred) but does it really have to be shown so graphically though? Then there's some movies that have an arguably unnecessary rape scene. Like the movie Deliverance. That's a damn good movie nearly ruined by that rape scene and in my opinion, the scene could have been left out and it wouldn't change the movie much at all. Any other scenes y'all feel this way about?"

He goes into that house and heals up. Then after 1-2 days he gets found and there's an ambush on this safe house that looks abandoned. But on the inside it's clearly fine.   The Old Guard vibes/John wick (dunno why)  It's a “recent movie”. Not older than 2010 I believe so.  Edit: I'm thankful with everyone, thank you for your replies.

But then it just went in a weird direction with the whole moving to Los Angeles, and the whole generic main character becomes a different person when he reaches success and fame but then redeems himself and realizes the most important things in life... That's beautiful and all but idk, it shouldn't really have gone in such a generic way imo!

I'm not the greatest writer with things like this and it's probably going to be very train of thought but here goes…  I grew up in the 2000s and lived through the initial buzz and phenomena of the American Pie movies. I wasn't old enough to actually go see them, but me and my brother would sneakily watch them whenever we could. They had a type of mythos around them for people of my age and revitalised the raunchy comedy genre. We even had films that weren't the same genre marketing themselves as if they were. Some movies even outright stole the logo (Can't Hardly Wait which came out first, but used the exact same logo as AP for subsequent releases).   After the initial three movies that had somewhat diminishing returns, the franchise divulged into yearly straight to dvd releases tethered only by the Stifler name and Eugene Levys wonderful acting. Despite some of these not being that good, they were still kind of big in the sense that the brand never died out. Then 'American Reunion' came out. It was a decent box office success and overall a pretty good film, but for whatever reason we never got a sequel even though one was announced and the cast had even signed onto it.   In the years following that one (it's been over a decade 💀), it has been pretty much crickets. A year or two ago we got a Netflix spin off thing that made ZERO noise whatsoever and I feel like even the original movies have faded into obscurity and have become a forgotten relic of their time.   Where do you think the franchise stands in this current day? Do you think a reboot/remake could happen? Would it even work in this day and age? I recently rewatched and there are a few of them that somewhat stand the test of time (mainly the original, the sequel, reunion and even band camp kind of)."

They had a frickin lore for Santa Claus! A lore that made sense and also explains why he is able to kick such ass. He even has a character arc. It surprised me a lot. The movie had nailed almost every part (a few characters and the last 2 mins nagged me a bit but not much) but honestly no complains.   A major props to action. I thought this would be a fast and furious kinda action - somewhat family friendly and PG at best, but no. I'm glad the filmmakers made the movie so goddamn violent and gory. The movie certainly earned and deserved the title.  David Harbour was amazing! He had no business being that good of a Santa but here we are. Honestly I wouldn't mind watching a sequel for this movie. Alos I would love a prequel explaining Santa's lore because if you watch and for those who have watched know how badass those few glimpses of past were.   Way better than my expectations and surely one of the best action movies of the year that surprisingly has a good story."

        "body": "13 Going On 30 is a film released in 2004, about a girl who was 13 in 1987 and wakes up as a 30 year old in 2004.  If the movie was to be released in 2023, it would take place in 2006, a close enought time frame from the original release - and btw why by so anal about it ? LOL it could take place on 2021 regardless of when its released, so the time lines would line up perfectly.  Contenders for song for the party dance scene on the place of Thriller would be Toxic by Britney Spears or Crazy In Love by Beyonce, but honestly my personal pick would be either Yeah by Usher or In Da Club by 50 Cent  Jenna works as a shallow magazine editor, that could translate very well in the current influencer culture. She could be an influencer's producer or even an influencer herself.  We are also going through a 00's nostalgia on pop culture right now, just like there was for the 80's in the early 00's.  Finally, there's a shortage of romantic comedies, specially ones with such an innocent vibe to it, and I think a studio could greenlit if it was based on a classic, based on nostalgia alone lol"

My take is he had an abusive wife, a wife whom had zero respect for him that's explained why she called him coward when she was dying.   The cougar is symbol for her being in heat all the time. Her wife is the representation of a never satisfied/unhappy wife. Joe is a representation of average joe. Rascal is guilt.   Also it is hinted by earlier convo that he ate his friend, but didn't enjoy it (all the random question to Joe about eating human, eating human is gross).  The one thing I didn't understand was when he said I don't want to do this anymore  Why did she said It don't work that way   Finally at the end I think a good metaphor it showed the wife throwing a bouquet of lavender. Get it? Lavender/love ender. But her face is evil so wicked. This is one of the reasons I didn't understand the scene I mentioned, because it seems like what Joe did was justified (in the film of course not in real life, this is fiction)"

And what a heart-felt emotional climax - one I certainly didn't expect, and was so much better than any movie version's ending I've seen. But I admit I haven't seen them all.  I've obviously watched the Disney animated version, and now I've read the book I can see how they've cleverly implemented various parts of the book to create the shortened down version of the story. The recent live action/cgi version tried to replicate it but with alterations that clearly makes it an inferior version. Then I had high hopes for Guillermo Del Toro's new stop-motion version. But having just finished it, I actually think it is unfortunately the furthest from the book. They changed/added so much it's almost a whole new story. In fact I'd go so far to say I won't be watching it again anytime soon as it left me very disappointed.  This leads me to ask has anyone seen other more obscure versions of the tale, and are they closer to the book? I don't think there'll be anything exact as there is so much that happens in the book in such a short amount of pages. But I'm interested to know about all the different versions out there."

I had a general idea about flying saucers, mystery and perhaps some Jordon Peele-esque allusions to things like filmmaking/sci-fi tropes/etc.   This film made no sense, and almost all of the elements are undercooked and half-baked in my sure-to-be-flamed opinion ;)   Let's start with the obvious flaws:  1. D. Kaluuya - acting was catatonic and truly uninspired. I like this dude, but I wouldn't call this a high point for him AT ALL. His arc in this story also made no sense and random is what I would describe his impact. For some reason lots of people give him the benefit of the doubt here but I'm not seeing it. Could possibly be replaced by pretty much any comparable actor in this role.   2. Steven Yeun's character - probably the most intriguing part of the story, made no sense. And this comes from a Twin Peaks fan who often looks for underlying meaning to subtle plot points and general mood that probably goes nowhere but up a butthole lol. There was lots of slow-zooms and mysterious camera angles but ultimately his arc didn't accomplish anything except be a red herring? Maybe I'm missing something but my general feeling is there were cuts made to his side of the story and it messed up the meaning. Anyone agree? I truly like Yeun as an actor but this just wasn't it.  3. The monkey scenes. I mean, this piqued my curiosity throughout, and I was begging for it to come back round and imbue the film with a underlying message of....something...anything...I'm truly confused about what Peele thought he was communicating here with these vignettes? Once again, maybe I'm missing something so if someone can help, that would be appreciated.  4. The ending: To me, a good ending has to have some level of threat or risk involved. The good guys have to overcome or not overcome a challenge and this leads to a satisfying conclusion (for me personally). However, like other not-so-good films I've seen, this threat is never really present, and the good guys kind of accomplish...something...just in the nick of time? Before what?  5. That saucer: now I know this is a personal subjective thing, but for some reason, the flying cowboy hat with a butthole never truly landed for me...Maybe he was trying to say something about filmmakers being up their own butts? Truly baffling stuff. It kinda ruined my immersion and I think a more traditional saucer would actually have helped since the overt mixing tropes and allusions kind of muddled an already muddled story.  Sorry for the long ramble, I'm truly looking for some discussion around these points in good faith. I realise lots of people liked this film but I wouldn't give this anything higher than The Matrix Resurrections, which was also a truly confusing journey from a filmmaker probably overstretching themselves. Also if I need to censor anything in the post please let me know - trying to be vague as possible for those who haven't seen it."

Sicario  &#x200B;  For La la Land, it was a musical and I'm not into musicals, and on top of that, it was about a pianist, and since I play piano I feared that they would botch that part up.  When I saw it later, I realize I was being silly.  It was just a fantastic film.     For Sicario, I read a film critic's review in a newspaper.  He said that Sicarios was so-so, because the female protagonist was weak character.  I was disappointed, and didn't go.  I saw it later, and realize that the reviewer did not understand the cinematic role of the female protagonist played.  It was stupid.  And I kicked myself for not going to the theater because of a bad review."

They're both great films, but Alien is so much more realistic, artistic, creepy and well acted/written/directed. A far, far more effective dark sci-fi movie. Aliens has good sci-fi still, but the writing sucks, the aliens look like crap most of the time and the acting is SO cringe except for Lance Henricksen as Bishop. Sigourney Weaver's performance is so corny and never believable, which is weird considering how good she is in Alien. Plus, it's a military, whip out the giant guns movie. I just think it's so dull compared to the original which to me is a work of art by H.R. Giger and Dan O'Bannon."

Ebert in his review described the movie as like Jackie Chan and Buster Keaton meet Quentin Tarantino and Bugs Bunny  and I would have to agree with him on that.

I will never stop watching them every year, but I will be adding Home Alone 3 to my annual Christmas movie watch list. The main reason that I think it is better is because it's writing is way better. I never realized until this latest rewatch that Hughes wrote the 3rd movie (and actually didn't write the 2nd).   The story is much more cohesive, and makes way more sense to me. First off, the kid actually tries to call the cops multiple times and only resorts to fending off the criminals himself because nobody listens to him. Second, the villains have an actual reason to keep pursuing the kid because the chip is worth so much. I never understood why Harry and Marv didn't just stop after the second trap, because they could have just left and probably never been caught.  The characters are all just better in general too. Alex is so much more likeable than Kevin, because Kevin is kind of a little monster. He hates his family and is happy they are gone? That is horrendous and abusive. The 3rd movie is centered around a more normal family that I can relate to way more.  To just kind of sum it all up I think Home Alone 3 has less plot holes, more likeable characters, and is generally more entertaining. I've seen negative posts about it before and I think everyone should at least give it a try to decide for yourself."

War movie - soldiers are in trenches and they despise one of their comrades because his dad is a high ranking military official so he gets preferential treatment in the trench. There's a mission where a group of them need to reestablish a communication wire that was severed in no man's land. The privileged soldier's only job is to sound a whistle if he sees enemies advancing on his comrades. He sees enemies but is too scared to whistle so his comrades die while he crawls back and reports to command that he did everything he could. Except, one of the squad members survives the attack, comes back to the trench, and reports that the privileged soldier did not sound the whistle and that's why the mission failed. May have been in black and white 50/50.    .  2. Gangster/mob movie. A crippled mob boss in a wheelchair and his right hand are in a dim workshop interrogating one of the gang members that failed an assignment. While the boss is making the failed member feel like he's ok and forgiven, he asks his right hand to find a pair of scissors. His right finds a small set, mob boss says asks for something bigger. They keep talking. Right hand finds bigger scissors, mob boss says they need even bigger scissors. Mob boss asks failed member what he likes to do - the answer is dance with his wife. Mob boss says he likes to dance too and mockingly shakes his wheelchair. His right hand finds a pair of shears, giant scissors, and mob boss says they are perfect. They proceed to cut the failed members legs off - not really sure if it was on or off screen.   .   Thanks again!

'cause while i appreciate the message about overcoming depression and finding self-worth, i can't help but feel it also sends an implicit false message that *every* person brings this dramatically abundant amount of value to the world. and also, i feel like the movie should've chosen a more average person to convey that message, instead of someone who has literally saved people's lives and prevented multiple deaths and tragedies ('cause realistically, most people have never done that).   i know what the movie was trying to do with the message, and while i respect that, i personally think it pushed the boundaries a little too much with how much good things he was responsible for. for example, of *course* if someone saves their brother's life and helps their family have a successful career, that person automatically has a lot of value and purpose by default. but those things, along with other extreme examples of this him existing being the better reality thing, are not even close the lives of the vast majority of people. if you choose an exaggeratedly prolific person in their good deeds, like the protagonist in this movie, of *course* it's gonna be easy to point out why he should've been born and why he shouldn't kill himself. but most people simply are not nearly as important as that and will never be. and that's where i criticize it, 'cause if you're gonna send this message to the viewers, and if you want it to really stick the way you want to, then you must choose a more average, relatable protagonist.  so, overall, do i think it's a wonderful life is a bad movie? no. i still think it's a fairly decent movie in general, despite my mixed feelings. and i'm curious to hear what others think."

For me, I had a prediction for Avatar 2 and the sequels, that maybe they'd explore the idea of there being bad/evil Na'vi, because, well...if there are good and bad humans then it can be assumed there are bad Na'vi as well as good na'vi, and while the Recoms kindof fulfilled that role, it still wasn't what I was expecting, also I don't think they will because that may contradict the themes Cameron wants for the series and what he wants the Na'vi to represent, not too mention, like I said, the Recoms seem to be fulfilling that role in some way.  Another prediction I had that didn't come true is that, well, I thought that that the Spiderman NWH was going have a new post credits scene maybe setting up plot point for Spiderman 4, like maybe have Kingpin running for Mayor, or Revealing Mysterio was still alive and somehow still retains the memories of Peter, or God forbid, Morbius, Vulture, and Aaron Taylor-Johnson Kraven find a way into the MCU, and while there was a new post credits scene, it clearly wasn't any of those.  Finally, the last prediction I had that didn't came true was that Smile was secretly a sequel to Truth or Dare, you know, that stupid Blumhouse Horror movie/film. That prediction was mostly from just seeing the teaser for the first time when I went to go see Top Gun Maverick and not knowing what it was at first, of course was I did more research on it, I quickly found out that prediction clearly can't be true.  TLDR: I had predictions for Avatar 2 and sequels that the story would explore the idea of good and evil Na'vi, but this did not happen. I also predicted that the Spiderman NWH movie would have a post-credits scene setting up a plot point for Spiderman 4, but this did not happen either.

I feel guilty every time I watch it, but as I'm laughing at it's romance-whiplash, Rachel McAdams cringe performance, and big dramatic outbursts, I'm also rooting for every character, belly laughing at subtle physical comedy, and moved to tears at least 3 or 4 times.

I had thought the book would be almost impossible to film without rushing through its' many plotlines. But any time I felt that a scene was a little too quick in treatment, the film would suddenly linger patiently on a philosophical point, using innovative filming techniques and powerful Tolstoy language to take you to new heights.

There's definitely some really good elements to Inception, like the loaded cast and acting of course. Using the first half of the movie for world building was also nice. And the visuals and action sequences were great. So it's not bad by any means.  And yet, Inception's plot didn't manage to feel...convincing? Maybe it's because I wasn't really attached to any of the characters emotionally, or the concept of levels of dreams was interesting but not executed well (in my opinion). In the second half, the movie tries to do so much in a short amount of time that I stopped getting heavily invested. I've seen people online saying Inception is enjoyable if it's not taken seriously, which would be fine, but...the movie takes itself seriously by spending so much time on world building that I feel like I should try to oblige.   Inception already feels outdated as a mind-bending movie, which is disappointing because of how critically acclaimed it is. The Prestige, Nolan's work that came out 4 years earlier, has aged much better in my opinion. Maybe because it has a much simpler presentation that constantly convinces and hooks the viewer."

I wouldn't necessarily ask for a Sam Elliott or a John Wayne type that would just turn the movie into a caricature of itself and I am guessing director Jane Campion wanted avoid that partly by casting him for the role but I think it was too far out of the expectations which made him stick out in a bad way.

        "body": "   As the year comes to a close, I've been looking back at the film/tv scores that have stood out and made a lasting impression on me from 2022 and would love to hear any of your favorite scores as well, I'm sure there's plenty I've missed that I ought to have seen/heard!  Now, my personal favorites are scores that I consider 10/10: they have enhanced the cinematic experience by elevating the films they were  written for to new heights, and both integrate perfectly into the film as well as stand out as a stand-alone listening experience.  **Babylon**, Justin Hurwitz.  Amazing film, amazing score, I've had it on repeat  since the day the score was released.  Lovely style throughout, killer melodies, incredibly in-your-face in the best of ways.  **Glass Onion**, Nathan Johnson.  Also an amazing film with an amazing score.  The  score fit perfectly, was allowed to really be a character in the film, and I love the overall classic-hollywood-murder-mystery style that was allowed to be really prominent.  **All Quiet on the Western Front**,   Volker Bertelmann.  A surprising stand out film and score for me; it's an utterly visceral film that I think everyone should watch.  The  score legitimately gave me goosebumps a few times, and really added to the viewing experience.  And it makes me feel all sorts of things listening to it on its own.  **Station 11**, Dan Romer.  Beautiful show with a beautiful & eclectic score.  The show came out end of '21 but the score wasn't released until '22, so I'm counting it as a 2022 score release.  The stand out tracks make me want to sit and weep because things are beautiful and heartbreaking at  the same  time.  **House of the Dragon**,  Ramin Djawadi.  One of the few elements that maintained quality throughout GOT was Djawadi's score, and his work on HOTD did not disappoint.  I loved the show and loved the score more.     The  following scores are 10/10's in that they were utterly fantastic in the  context of the films they were written for, but are not ones I've actively sought out or felt was a great listening experience on their  own (though that's certainly subject to change!):  **The Banshees of Inisherin** by Carter Burwell, **Bones and All** by Reznor/Ross, **Everything Everywhere All at Once** by Son Lux, **Where the Crawdads Sing** by Mychael Danna, **Nope** by Michael Abels, **Top Gun Maverick** by Zimmer/Balfe/Faltermeyer/Gaga, **The Batman** by Michael Giacchino, and **Andor** by Nicholas Britell.     And then scores that I generally liked but have some form of a caveat, keeping them out of my favorites for the year:  **Prey**, Sarah Schachner.  This one ALMOST made it to my personal favorites but not quite.  Phenomenal score for a surprisingly great movie with a few  stand out tracks, would highly recommend anyone see it who has not.  **Kenobi**, John Williams.  The main theme was great, but that's the only thing I really enjoyed.  **The Rings of Power**, Bear McCreary.  There's parts I liked and it generally fit the show well, but it somehow lacked heart and isn't something I've enjoyed by itself.  **Black Panther Wakanda Forever**, Ludwig Göransson.  Solid score, some really dope added elements with the Mayan materials, but as a whole I didn't love the score as much as I would have liked.  **Turning Red**, Ludwig Göransson.  I've only heard a few tracks from it and have not seen the movie but WOW those few tracks are perfect.  **Kimi**, Cliff Martinez.  A bit of a departure from what I'm used to hearing Martinez do, but I liked it in the film!  **Women Talking,**   Hildur Guðnadóttir.  I haven't seen the movie yet and have only heard parts of the score, but the parts I've heard are great and, like Martinez, a departure from what I'm used to hearing with her scores.  **Jurassic World Dominion** by Michael Giacchino, **Doctor Strange Mutiverse of Madness** by Danny Elfman, and **Thor Love and Thunder** by Michael Giacchino.  These three were all fine...the scores generally fit the movies well, but there's things I really wished had been changed or done differently, and they ultimately fell a little flat for me even if  there's tracks in them all that I enjoyed.  Apologies for the hugely long and rambling post...I get excited talking about film scoring, clearly.  What scores have you really enjoyed this year?  Are there ones I'm missing that I really need to hear?"

And not just a song they thought sounded cool... lyrics that reference the films. 'Flash' more so, of course, but 'Princes of the Universe' is pretty heavily influenced by Highlander aswell.    So if you originally have these movies at a 6/10... I think the addition of Queen should boost them up to at least an 8/10. Cause to fair, no other film can ever have Queen do their soundtrack. Sure, you can get Brian May to write it... but without Freddie it wouldn't be the same.    Now I'm not here to pretend Queen is everyone's taste... but I think you have to respect the fact that the band only ever did original songs for these two movies. Regardless of reason or circumstances. That makes them unique films. Rare, perhaps?     I will also shout-out Labyrinth whilst I'm here. Not only did David Bowie do every single song... even the baby vocals... but he also acted and helped with the dance choreography in the film. And Freddie and David were both friends. So it's all connected. May they both rest in peace."

Showing the ridiculousness of believing in religion and how they gaslight families into becoming followers to be able to sexually abuse children?  I googled and searched on Reddit but haven't seen anyone really mention this yet as the movie's main intention.  Remember the constant mention of “flocking” — referenced as white snow continued to get sprayed all over the tree.  And how are they going to have her just walk straight into Santa's groin like this, with the next frame showing white snow exploding into the frame?   Or am I just high?  EDIT — I mean, just read these quotes with the context of writers attempting to mock religion..  1. “It's not about logic. It's about magic.” — exactly how religions explain “faith”  2. “Christmas: If you're not on the bus, you're under it.” — Christianity: If you don't believe it, you're - terrible person and going to hell.  3. “Faith may be the last great universal concept holding the whole world together.” — how often is this a theme in religion?"

Sandra Bullock (Annie) and Jason Patric (Alex) severely lacked the chemistry that the Sandra Bullock and Keanu Reeves (Jack) had but Willem Dafoe (Geiger) always plays a good bad-guy and there is enough action, jeopardy and humour to keep you mildly entertained throughout.   I thought the introduction was actually quite good, it showed Annie is still the same loveable goof as from the first film and Alex although not as bad-ass as Jack does have something about him. Fairly quickly after they get on the boat it starts to kick off, straight in to the action which was another positive. It's always nice to see the 'bad-guy' thwarting the 'good-guys' first few attempts at 'saving the day' (admittedly it would be nice if he did more than tap a few keys on a keypad to do it but i get it, he's a hacker) and much like the first one It's not quite as simple as surviving the initial threat.  Admittedly the beginning of the end sequence is pretty interminable, after they narrowly avoid the oil tanker they then proceed with a drawn out, slow collision with a harbour, which felt so unnecessarily long and entirely predictable. I don't know if this was left in to just pad the length of the movie or what but it just feels so anti-climatic.   Ultimately I just think that's its an average film, it doesn't do anything really well and has plenty of flaws but a score of 4% on rotten tomatoes seems harsh."

I feel like he had a moustache, possibly handlebar. I think it then switched to a contemporary time and followed a woman possibly in the same house the man who was hanged had been in. I'm remembering, like, a dormer attic/farm house type house. Then YTV realized the error, cut off the broadcast, and switched to playing Freaky Stories while they sorted it out. I was sufficiently shook (and I never did see Little Rascals).   I wonder if anyone else remembers this and might remember what movie that was?? It's always bothered me!!"

If you feel like you've seen them all, or even if you don't, give this one a try.  Clark Gable and Claudette Colbert are great together.

Spoilers with some of the plot details I can remember: >!The boyfriend gets replaced with an alien, but theres a surprsingly effective misdirection where the movie frames it as though the girlfriend was the one who got replaced. The alien's powers are really just a super-cheap looking long CGI finger knife which seems more goofy than menacing! The alien eventually confronts her, realizing the jig is up, but then is like I absorbed your bf's feelings! Including his love for you! I love you! So the aliens just chasing after her around the woods shouting but I really love you! like some cheesy romcom. By this point I had given up completely and then was won back by the sheer gall of it. Eventually the alien copies the girl, and then to defeat her the girl is like you absorbed my anxiety disorder as well! and then induces a literal panic attack in the alien by just listing things humans get anxious about. Eventually toward the end of the movie she has to outsmarts the alien by swimming into the ocean while hes bleeding and he follows her into the water and gets attacked by A FUCKING SHARK!! WHAT! Then it has a this invasion is just the beginning lame ending.!<  Theres probably some details im forgetting"

I'd been hearing all about this great twist forever, and how King liked it better than his own ending, so admittedly my expectations were moderately high.  We get started and my brain starts immediately connecting dots- our main man is a scifi artist, spooky military fog happens, and all of a sudden we've got unseen scifi monsters roaming about.   Then we get evidence of one of the creature's tentacles- but it mysteriously disappears when the strong-minded guy who doesn't believe in that shit comes to look.  Then crazy lady starts telling everyone it's bible shit and we get swarms of locusts. She believes that God will save her when one of them lands on her, and in response to her prayers it flies off and leaves her alone. People start listening to the main guy, and then to her, and the more scared people are and the more they believe, the crazier shit gets.   By the end I was 100% convinced that the mist was a military experiment or otherdimensional phenomenon used to manifest people's fears and beliefs into reality, responding most strongly to those with the strongest imaginations/personal realities (the artist, the pragmatist, the madwoman.)  It was such a beautiful metaphor- the mist as a physical manifestation of humanity's imaginations and their fear of the unknown. Showing how mob mentality takes us over, and an individual's reality can be subsumed by groupthink (the pragmatist who later gets killed at the pharmacy.) Warring ideologies made manifest. How humanity is often its own worst enemy, allowing our fears to drive us to create a reality that's so much worse than it needs to be (since none of that shit would have happened if they could've stopped being fear-driven dicks for like 5 seconds.)  But no, the bullshit “fog dimension to an alternate monster universe” strawman is actually what they decided to go with, ~~with pointless killing of a kid thrown in to boot (and by the way did they HAVE to make the kid wake up in time to see his dad shoot him? Dicks.)~~  Fuck you, whoever came up with that lame ass ending.  /rant   Edit: It seems like everyone is fixating on the kid killing thing. That was a bit of a throwaway comment, sorry to trigger y'all. Up with the kid deaths in media.  My main bone is with what the mist eventually wound up being- a portal to interdimensional monsters rather than an allegorical tool manifesting the fears and internal realities of those who come into contact with it."

When I see trailers for the new ones that have came out recently like the Elvis one, I cringe and for some reason it makes me physically want to break something. I hate them. However I do live music documentaries.    Sports movies like Friday night lights, miracle, coach Carter, Hoosier, the rookie,  blindside, any given Sunday, etc. Those movies are very bothersome to me. I can't watch them. I ALSO LOVE sports documentaries.   I'm not great with words or finding meanings behind things, so if anyone can.please help me understand why I hate these kind of movies, that would be a great help."

For me, the most obvious answer is Shrek 2. It surpasses the original for me (although the original is also a banger, and there is a lot to be said for its simplicity compared to Shrek 2). I also liked Frozen II a lot, which I know may be somewhat controversial- although it definitely wasn't as good as the original. Aladdin and the King of Thieves (the third in the Aladdin trilogy, though, not the second) also stands out as not being garbage imo, but I wouldn't call it great. What else?"

Anyway, what sparked this off is that i recently found my old VHS tape of jurassic park (my fave film), i've watched it a lot on streaming, dvd, blu ray ect. I thought i'd watch it on VHS and i honestly think the VHS and dvd versions of the movie are unmatched because of how imperfect and sort of dirty the film looks. Maybe the grit hides imperfections and makes everything blend in better? who knows  is it stupid of me to say that movies are too good looking now? is that stupid?  I feel like one of those born in the wrong generation kids (im early 20's btw), but movies on vhs tapes feel more like real cinema to me. idk i'm probably just smelling my own farts :)"

Heard about this sequel and TBH I naturally set my expectations super-low but I tried not to think about it and just go in blind.   Wow. Simply.....wow. The writing, the plot, the directing, the acting (by almost all of the old cast!), the characters...the lack of your typical Hollywood tropes and CGI stupidity....I'm blown away. There were so many different ways they could've screwed it up but it went the opposite way. They even managed to turn Ralphie's wife and kids into genuinely likeable characters in their own right who fit in with the style of the movies. I laughed hysterically...I even shed a mini tear (IT WAS JUST A DROP DAMMIT!). I can't remember any Xmas movie I genuinely wanted to watch again besides the first Christmas Story, and now this.  I'm wondering why I'm not hearing more buzz about it? If anything it does a wonderful job at capturing the spirit of the 1st film without being to forced or heavy-handed."

I'm very good at writing deep, meaningful, confusing, ontologically monstrous, cosmically horrifying material but I struggle with the more fundamental action, explosions, chaos, suspense, aspects of the film. What are some good tips or key things to hit on to make sure the reader is pulled into the action?  I love good chase scenes. Some of my favorites is the motorcycle chase with the cop at the beginning of First Blood and pretty much every car chase in Ronin is amazing.

She has to touch his hair and look at him further even though just a few seconds ago she watched him physically transform in front of her.

It's a shame because Villeneuve is one of my favourite modern day directors and now he's tied up doing this dreck for the next decade or so when he could be making a whole host of more interesting films.  It honestly feels like the futurama joke of a film in slow motion, nothing of interest happens the entire time. Characters just seem to get on with the plot, and the plot is the most generic blockbuster plotline I've ever seen, especially when you consider at least the standard generic blockbuster has a bloody ending! This film just stopped and I remember being in the cinema, everyone clapping and being happy and that and just thinking what the fuck did we see a different film? It was the worst movie I've ever seen in the cinema and that includes when I saw Grown Ups 2 with Adam Sandler (at least it was half the length and had jokes that even if they didn't make you laugh got some kind of reaction out of you).  I tried watching it again today and I had to turn it off an hour and a half in. Even the beautiful cinematography the film is praised for feels dull to me. Big empty halls of brown with a bit of light, and characters that sit there reading the script with zero emotion. Nothing stands out, there's a 10 minute long bit where he talks to a gardener and the gardener is like these trees are so important then the trees get burnt down half an hour later and it was filmed like that was a big emotional moment. Seriously, whilst I weren't a fan of the book I could at least understand who it was after, it had a great plot with complicated characters and there was no clear good guys and bad guys. But in this film the good guys go out of their way to save people, and the bad guys all look like nazis living on their big nazi planet. Fuck me. What a waste of time, not for me watching it, but for all the cast and crew that spent months/years of their life on the most intricately painted yellow/grey wall ever."

Arnold obviously has some iconic lines and that's all great, but other than that I thought the only real highlight to be Robert Patrick.

While box office is not always the best criteria, most of the times it does work. The Shawshank Redemption is one of the few movies that consistently reminds me that Box Office is not everything.  When it comes to movies on streaming though, it's based on Word of Mouth from Youtube. I've found that rotten tomatoes reviews and even Top 10 trending charts don't matter cause the former most of the times is too less and the latter can be easily manipulated by the streamer. Mostly the streaming movies sucked but I came to love Tomorrow War and Do Revenge based on YouTube recommendations.  I sometimes use critic reviews and IMDb reviews in case of tie breaks.

The plot goes like this, guy ends up stuck in the middle of nowhere due to a car malfunction, he goes to the nearest house and is welcomed by a family. FROM WHAT I REMEMBER, the family are weird as shit and keep a handicapped son in the basement who likes to feed on human flesh. THIS IS ALL I REMEMBER, and I've tried to find this movie by searching on google countless times and the only movie that sort of resembles what I'm talking about is The Hills Have Eyes, and even then that movie doesn't come close.

For many reasons, such as Billy Bob Thortons performance, his characters dynamic with the kid being very well done and believable, the kid himself, whole you could argue can be alittle bit annoying at times, still very sincere and still feels like a realistic portrayal of a kid, and his nonchalant reactions to Willys outburst are just hilarious, to the other characters also being very memorable, to the comedy just being so funny, like, I was laughing like crazy throughout the film.  But I think the reason I move it the most, is that despite it being a very un-convential Christmas movie, it actually has a very positive and feel good message. Yes it does have raunchier humor and darker moments, but at its core it still has a great message about not being alone, Bonding with others, and changing for the better. It's kindof like an R-rated version of the Grinch, actually. So despite being a Un-Convential Christmas film, still manages to also feel like a traditional Christmas film simultaneously as well. Also, it's just a really funny movie. My favorite scenes being with the kid with the ice cream, his freak out in the food court, and the scene of him driving the kid back home.   So yeah, great movie, easily one of the funniest Christmas movies of all time, but also one of my top 5 most favorite/best Christmas/holiday movies of all time. I couldn't recommend it enough."

The script is very good, but the direction actively hindered my ability to be affected by the characters' plight. The camera moves without reason and slow motion shots / melodramatic music jars you in moments that would otherwise be impacting. Every time I was being pulled into the film, the director would do some unnecessary and unenjoyable stylistic flourish that pulled me out and reminded me I was watching a movie.  Awhile ago I watched a movie, based on a play, that entirely takes place at a police station as a black mother and her white detective husband grapple with the news that their son has been killed by cops. I was continually distracted because the director could not just plant the camera and let the actors convey, reserving the camera movement for when it would be most powerful tool. Instead, the camera was constantly tracking in, out and laterally for absolutely no reason whatsoever. Camera movements convey meaning and, when a director is aware of how the camera motion will affect the audience, can be used to greatly enhance the viewer's experience: random camera movements do the opposite.  Anyways, I thought I'd vent and get downvoted. Can you think of any movies with great scripts and bad direction?"

        "body": "Spoilers :   Many people have noted the similarities between these films : a group of outside observers stumble onto a community at which point, with a building sense of dread, they uncover the dark, violent intensions that this group has for them. Both prey on a sense of guilt that is uncovered in the protagonists. Both engage in a violent reaction against consumerist, egotistical modern society. And both , of course, end in fire. However, despite the similarities, I think that the two communities, the Chefs and the Swedish village, represent radically opposite political idealogies: communism and fascism respectively.    Midsommar makes it references to fascism obvious. As soon as the anthropologists land in Sweden there is a huge banner advertising a far right anti-immigrant political party. The community, like fascism, is based in obscure mythical origins and a violent commitment to tradition. And it's appeal (as shown in the infamous crying scene) is based, like fascism, in the sense of community and belonging missing in the modern world.    The Menu is less obvious , but at least clear in the anti -capitalist designs of the chef collective. Ralph Fiennes chef repeatedly calls out how the rich and money pervert his restaurant. The bankers are selfish, corrupt, assholes. One character is labeled guilty just because she was rich enough to not have to take out student loans. The reduction of everyone to simply “chef” instead of their names mirrors the universalizing title of comrade in communism. There is no commitment to tradition, only an ideal. And like Stalinism, and unlike in Midsommar of fascism, the terrifying sense of guilt cannot be escaped, there is no one group that is elevated above the others, and even the chefs themselves carrying out this violence are guilty and have to die.    Some might call this a reach but I think at least the fact that both movies are very political is undeniable."

Also, *Dr Jekyll and Mr. Hyde* is in the public domain (the original book was written by Robert Louis Stevenson, and it was published in January 1886).  I know that, in comparison, *Treasure Planet* (2002, John Musker and Ron Clements) is a pastiche of *Treasure Island* (1883, also Robert Louis Stevenson) in a science-fiction context (a steampunk universe to be exact).

I mean the choreography is good but Ferrell's vocal range just doesn't fit the Broadway show tune style the songs are going for; he's so flat. Octavia Spencer is flat as well. Reynolds is a bit better but he's not great. And Patrick Page, the only professional singer of the cast, barely gets the chance to sing and is cast as the character who is actually trying to stop people from singing.  Also most of the songs sound so...samey and generic. And the songs kind of overtake the movie; there are sections of the movie that are just songs, then long stretches where no singing happens, and then back to song to song back to back.  I kinda wish they just made it a straight out comedy, a sort of modern day Scrooged, rather than just making it a musical honestly."

Seeing the emperor grow up was so cool, I almost wanted more of him when he was younger. Living in the Castle not being able to leave reminded me a lot of The Truman Show, which I also watched recently (wow to that movie too, definitely deserves it's own post) and there was so much to love. Seeing this old world slowly become Westernized. The bike, the glasses... and them speaking in English the entire time... I don't know why they decided to do that but it added to the surrealism, for better or worse.   The tutor was such a good character too. The wife was awesome too and that scene where the hands undress her as she kissed him... this movie was a fever dream in the best way at times. But then when they left the Castle, it felt like it became a different movie. The Emperor trying to hold onto his power, the only life he's ever known... I don't know enough about the history behind this, so I feel some of this was lost on me but it felt so tragic and I ended up hating and feeling bad for him. He's innocent, I can't blame him for holding onto the life he's ever known but he obviously made some bad decisions. But you can still see the love and goodness in him at odds with who he was taught to be.   Such a complex, fascinating and beautiful movie. Not to mention the SOUNDTRACK was so good. I knew Ryuichi Sakamoto from some other songs so when I saw his name I got so excited yet somehow I was still blown away.   Just wow, really. Such an amazing movie. I had to share my scattered thoughts as I'm on my commute.   How good are this directors other movies? Are there other historical movies that are worth watching in the same vein? I have no idea how accurate this movie was but it actually seems to be kind of honest, despite obvious dramatizations and artistic discretion. But I could be wrong"

It honestly surprised me how good it actually is, especially for a horror sequel from the 80s. It's genuinely creepy in parts (the rocking horse) and shocking (the locker room) and creative (the chalkboard whirlpool) and some wtf moments. It obviously took inspiration from Carrie, but it wasn't overly blatant. The acting is rather good as well and the special effects were well done for the time.

        "body": "**Spoiler warning**  First off I know I'm late this movies almost 2 years old   I'm trying to convince myself there's more to this movie but it screams Director gone too far in trying to be different without much constructive thought.   If you liked this movie I'd really like to know why and what you're take on it is because I honestly feel like I completely wasted 2 hours of life.    First of all.    Girl is chased on the road at night by a random car and forgets to call  authorities - or anyone.   The chaser stops his vehicle letting her get a sizeable lead on him.   He then creeps his car forward slowly to catch up because science dictates an object travelling 5 miles per hour can catch up to another object doing 30. That's how cars work.   The girl spots an empty gas station that's clearly closed - with her chaser far behind common sense tells her to get out of her vehicle and head to the gas station on foot.   Upon realising the gas stations closed she could get back into her car and speed off but decides she doesn't want to live so she sets off running into some weeds    The chaser at this point whose knowledge of speed has already been proven - slowly walks after the much younger woman whose running for her life.    The chaser is shown to be walking slowly in an area of flat land while the girl is running through weeds yet neither her or the truck driver who turns up see the person chasing her, we assume because the truck drivers never brought up.   We see fairly clearly that the chaser is a man, heavier set but not obese, straight walk, white male wearing a cap with facial hair and short head hair.    So this automatically rules out Albert, Jimmy or Deacon - right.  Ok.    At the end of the movie  Denzels character is still haunted by the past because he's made literally 0 strides in doing anything to solve that - ok?    Rami Maleks character is now also traumatised and kills someone - right.    Turns out Denzel also killed someone except it was a missing person….ok?    Cop and Coroner , fucking, cover up Denzels murder and were clearly willing to let whoever they found for the killings take the wrap for it and continue to let him work on the force - okedoke   But the missing person Denzel shot isn't the only missing person contributing to his trauma this is an irrelevant detail in the arc of the story….ok   Despite being an officer of the law and having a gun Malek becomes Leto's bitch digging all the holes in the world - cool bro.    So we get a 2 hour crime thriller with:   No character progression ☑️   A corrupt police force ☑️   The killers never caught ☑️    Dead girl gives Denzel a foot massage☑️   Rami and Denzel team up for quite literally no reason ☑️   Denzel accusing Jared Leto of having a boner = guilty ☑️   Rami Malek playing a cop who looks and speaks in more creepy fashion than Letos murderer-but-not-a-murderer character ☑️   Girl who was chased by the killer at the start for some reason takes note of Leto despite the fact she didn't see the fucker chasing her at the time.    She sees Jared, for the first time, in handcuffs and decides she needs a better look at him - *sigh* right.    And by the end - everything that happened in the movie becomes null, void and useless - why?    Becuase Albert Palm tree prime suspect is fucking dead.   Whether it was or wasn't him is now irrelevant - if it was he'll never pay and if it wasn't an innocent man's dead and Jimmys off the case anyway.    That's it. That's the conclusion of a 2 hour story    Creepy Albert for some reason has access to a plot of land - he convinces Malek, the police officer with a gun, to get into *his* car and then start digging up random bits of the land    He states that Deacon isn't welcome to join them yet he knows Deacons there, in Alberts time onscreen it's shown he's very aware of Deacons presence when following him - he knows Deacons a police officer whose going to probably notice his partners gone and so is the car he's been tailing all day.    Despite all of this Albert who is clearly not the killer, plans to kill Jimmy - the director who wanted to 'do something different' then has Jimmy smack Albert with a shovel which in typical fashion is enough to kill him instantly.    Nothing is discovered, no one is recovered and nothing really happens."

        "body": "Movie is actually about Evelyn reliving her life through complete dementia, and her memories are entangled with the movies she loved to watch before she lost her mind (kong fu, ratatouille, matrix.) the movie's real ending happened in the parking lot where Joy left the party after watching her mother have a mental breakdown. Joy leaves the party to commit suicide, this is represented by the everything bagel that is revealed to be a black hole (death) and why Joy asks her mother to “let her go.” Since we know Evelyn repeatedly told her daughter she was getting fat, it is assumed that she probably did say it again in the parking lot but that they probably didn't hug afterwards like Evelyn recalls. Joy most likely went home and poisoned herself with an everything bagel. It is the last 'real' memory Evelyn has of Joy, and it's also why the memory isn't portrayed in another dimension. After the death of their daughter, Waymond continues with the divorce, and Evelyn presumably loses the family business. The memories Evelyn has of Deidra are real, and she absolutely loved her but they are seen as happening in the hotdog dimension because the relationship happens after the events of the movie and while Evelyn's dementia is in a worse state. The movie probably takes place in a much older Evelyn's mind, and the ending we see is how she thinks the events actually took place. We can see one last glimpse into how Evelyn zones out (dementia) right before the closing scene."

They told you about an hour in that the wife faked it all to get her husband the death penalty and the movie just got better after that. Not only did she do all of that but she actually fakes a whole different crime to another guy and kills him just to get back to her husband.  There was a scene in the hospital where she called out the lead detective or officer for her being incompetent with how she handled the case. Usually in movies it'll be some kind of revenge thing or some way that the cop just HAS to get the truth. There was none of that. In the end there was no savior or magical evidence that arrested her.   They ended it with just truth and I felt that was one of the more realistic ways a movie has ended. I didn't see it coming at all and I actually was just waiting for something. A wire or a mistake. Unrelated but I watched Shutter Island and was much more impressed with the twist in Gone Girl compared to that. Movies always have to let the bad guy get caught. This was a pleasant surprise.

Great stuff  -Seeing Titane, with only a young couple, the young couple then left about a half an hour through it. And I got to watch a great movie all by myself, so I could laugh hysterically when she does a seductive dance in the firehouse  -Seeing Barbarian with a great crowd on opening Thursday night, and genuinely shocked at how much I loved it, considering marketing was pretty nill leading up to it.  -Seeing The Green Knight with a group of high people around my age, no one was disrespectful, everyone was just taking in everything and just having a crazy experience considering the content. They were genuinely into it, even though they didn't know what to think when it ended.  -Saw Thousand Years of Longing in an empty theater, wish I liked it more, but being all by myself and only paying $7 for a ticket is the best thing in the world"

A problem I see in these films are that they don't offer solutions to these lonely men, rather they emphasise that there is no exit out of this crazy world and the protagonists of their respective stories continue to suffer and recieve no help for their struggle. Are there any films out there which are able to simultaniously tap into the minds of these lonely men, and also show them that there's a way out of the cycle of loneliness and depression? Lonely men are able to relate towards these characters, but the characters they relate to are given no way to escape their cycle of loneliness, and so these men are gonna start believing that there's no escape for them too. What I believe is needed is a story that can show these men who need desperate help that there's still hope to hold onto, and that this cycle of loneliness isn't forever."

        "body": "So if you don't know the 300 movies were originally going to spark a full anthology series taking place in different battles across history. Zach Snyder wanted to make a movie taking place in the American Revolution, but Rise of an Empire was so bad he canceled it. So I watched Filmento's take on Rise of an Empire and thought up the perfect idea for a 300-style American war movie. Looking at all the aspects of the other two to make it.   1. Strong character  What made 300 such a good movie was its leading character, Leonidas was the King of Sparta and an inspiration to all of Greece. The movie shows this by having him go through struggles and trials, we see his origins as a young boy who was always on the verge of death and we see how it made him a skilled warrior and aspiring leader. But Rise of an Empire doesn't have that, hell, I don't even remember the main character's name. He's just an Athenian hoplite who killed Xerxes's father and is fighting a fleet that is never given any importance.   This is something we can fix with the Revolutionary War movie, George Washington is already the perfect candidate for the movie. As American history portrays him, he was a Virginian farmer who got selected for the British Army and lead a group of Natives to attack a French fort, triggering the French and Indian War. Already we have a backstory that can be delivered in perfect Zach Snyder fashion. George Washington also had to go through obstacles and challenges, he wasn't a good general in his early time and had to work to be the best, when the nation founded the Articles of Confederation had no way of collecting taxes for the states which caused his men to starve. He and his army were going to collapse until a Mercenary came and helped train the men. Hell, we could even give him John Wick fighting styles to make his character better.   2.  Exaggerated world  The point of 300 was that it was propaganda told by an untrustworthy narrator who explained everything the same as any Greek man in the war would think during ancient times. The Persian army was mostly dudes and skilled warriors, but the movie showed dudes, giant animals, immortal demons, and even whatever the hell that big guy was. Rise of an Empire didn't have this, sure we had dudes in tighty whities killing fully clothed dudes, but that was it. The only cool element of that movie was those shark monsters that are only a dream sequence.   The American Revolution was full of propaganda portraying the British as killers shooting innocent people and Americans as freedom fighters. The British enlisted different types of men to help fight for their cause as well. These included Native American warriors, Hessian Mercenaries, and escaped slaves. Hessians were already seen as boogeyman-type figures by the Colonists so it wouldn't be hard to portray them the same way immortals are portrayed in the movies. They could be these weird green reptilian monsters that speak inhumanely or giant black knights on horseback chopping people's heads off. Natives obviously could be seen in a similar way.   We could even have creatures from Native American mythology and European lore fighting on both sides creating chaos. Maybe Washington needs the help of an Oneida Shaman who takes him on a drug trip like in a Far Cry game. There could be giant wolves ripping throats or Bigfoot even, that's a no-brainer.   Obviously, historical accuracy wouldn't be a problem here since when did the last two films focus on that?   I'm not saying this would be a good idea, but it at least makes a sequel worthy of 300's name, what are your suggestions?"

I've never seen Joseph-Gordon Levitt in any other comedy, or Anthony Mackie in anything aside from being Falcon in the MCU but I liked them here.  And let's not forget Michael Shannon as Mr Green, one of my favorite side characters which had a couple of my favorite moments that made me laugh out loud. It had a pretty wholesome ending too. It's become a new yearly rewatch for me.  Anyone else love this one as much as I do? There needs to be more R rated Christmas comedies"

The way the characters speak has a natural yet over-the-top feel at the same time that draws you in and gets you invested. With his editing, it makes 3 hour movies like Casino and Wolf of Wall Street feel much shorter while giving each scene momentum.  That's what I believe makes him such a good director.

Andi then begins to break all the different glass art before throwing the Klear into the fire which ignites the helium which has been gathering inside the house due to the house running entirely off this new unstable fuel.!<  &#x200B;  >!So my question is why did she break the glass art? i know the house ran off the fuel but was it said that the statues themselves were made of the same substance and by breaking them she was releasing more of the flammable gas into the house? it seemed like the house was already filled with the gas and so really all she needed to do was throw the fuel in the fire to start everything burning.

Assuming this is the case then Scrooged is a sequel to A Christmas Carol as it follows on, years later and skipping potential other stories, from the events in the book.

I know that Mattel wouldn't take such a huge risk with their most iconic brand, but I just can't see Ryan Gosling on the screen in a hyper realistic Barbie world and not assume that there isn't something hiding below the surface.  At this point I'm scared that I'll walk into the theater expecting a bait and switch but just end up sitting in a room filled with 10 year old girls and their moms who are unnerved by my presence for 2 hours.

All of these were a great experience at the theater as well but my top 3 left me thinking about them for days and multiple viewings at the theater.   Everything Everywhere All at Once- The most creative, touching and crazy movie I've ever seen and really resonated with me. I still don't understand how they managed to make such a wild movie so easy to follow and understand. My new favorite film of all time.  Top Gun: Maverick- A true old school Hollywood blockbuster that demanded to be seen in IMAX and man it was INTENSE! Knowing how it was filmed in real jets and what the actors went through to make this film happen really added to the experience and made you feel as if you were inside the cockpit with them.  Avatar: The Way of Water- James Cameron is a mad lad. 13 years later he managed to pull off the same magic that Avatar (2009) brought to the big screen but did it much better imo. Visually mind blowing...I'm convinced that Weta FX is full of real wizards to be able to make this film a reality. I saw this in IMAX 3D opening night and wow the 3D is INCREDIBLE! Please see this in IMAX 3D if you can because it's the best way to watch it. The story is simple, yes, but it's very well done and will resonate with those who have a family. I was sad when I left the theater because it felt like I had went back to boring Earth. Tied for my number 1 favorite film of all time. Going to see it again with my family for Christmas!"

The way they act, the way they talk, is repellent from start to finish, and there never seems to be any consequence to anything, bolstering the nonchalant nihilism motivating the writers.  \\-The naturalistic storytelling is matched with a lack of any clear message other than: the world is going to hell, no one can do anything about it, so that's it. Given however the predicament the protagonist is in, we could at least have seen some come-uppance of some kind, but no.  \\-AIDS, dugs, alcohol abuse, race relations, homophobia, rape, teenage delinquancy.... all these subjects seem to be here to shock the US public and little else. There are plenty of triggers for the audience throughout the entire movie, but no clear message. The movie seems to be trolling the viewer, and little else.  \\-We see this serial triggering of reactions from several elements: -the sexual dialogue by Telly, then the boys, then intermixed with the dialogue by the girls, the fight scene in the park with the racial undertones (as the black guy is knocked out, brutalised and spat on), the verbal attack on the homosexual couple, robbing of an Asian store with verbal abuse to distract the owner, rape, the concept of HIV being spread to virgin girls.  This way beyond simple triggering by depicting decadent lives of inner city delinquency. It is a package to provoke the audience wherever possible. This is the bread and butter of this trashy movie.  &#x200B;  \\-Girls at 13 can be pretty naive, but I have trouble believing they are as naive as the main characters in the film are depicted.  The teenage girls of the movie are little more than dolls, on their way to be victims, and act as such.  &#x200B;  Basically fewer and fewer people will remember this movie and for good reason. It has nothing other than shock value, and the most vile dialogue you will ever hear in a movie.  I went into it with an open mind. The above is what I came out of it with. It is a shock fest with a nihilistic message and ultimately no larger statement to make.  I contrast this with Christiane F. – Wir Kinder vom Bahnhof Zoo which is the polar opposite of this, and with no less awful content, but with an actual message, based on an actual story.  &#x200B;  I rate: ***5 out of 100***  &#x200B;  EDIT: Several of the comments seem to claim I hated the movie because it wasn't a happy story or because it's subject matter may be disturbing, or there is some moral objection here. No. The issue is that these elements are all the movie has going for it, and ultimately does nothing with any of them. (The movie I compared it to above should however make clear that the content isn't the issue)  Despicable characters alone do not a great movie make. Edgy subject matter and shock value don't either. It seems to me that many believe the provocation and shocking depiction of the characters and juvenile life alone in and of themselves qualify the film as a form of naturalistic art. I do not. It is a necessary but not sufficient condition for it.  (Though one might wonder for those same people, if shock and disgusting subject matter is all that is needed, whether if the director himself drove over and unleashed a dump on their front porch, whether they might dissect the remains for objective value as it can't just be what it is at face value, surely)  For me, it's a void piece.  EDIT 2: I am reading all of the comments disagreeing with me. I respect those that take a different view and am trying to see where they are coming from, even though I feel quite secure in my judgement of the film.  EDIT 3: Many users have commented that this movie was not that exaggerated compared to their experience in similar areas and circumstances to what they grew up in. I respect that. However it does not completely detract from the point that the movie has little to say based on that experience, as I outlined above. The film is a movie, not a documentary, and shies away from making any larger statement beyond just a fictional depiction (albeit based on factual wider circumstances). I have been told at least 20 times I have missed the point of the movie, but the problem is that the point is not clear, or at least may only be visible to certain people, for those that hold a mirror to themselves and see something. Such being the case, I accept the limits to my own comprehension. However, from a general perspective I think the point is still muddled."

Which ones are your favorites though?   I am very partial to the Muppets version (1992). Michael Caine's stellar performance as Scrooge really carries the piece, and the comedy of the Muppets helps to reinforce the sense of hopeful joy the movie offers.   Scrooge (1970) is hard hitting, and a great musical. This movie has the best take on Stave Four that I have seen from any version.   Scrooged (1988) is a fun piece that did a job of applying the story to a modern setting. How many fingers does Mrs Claus have?  Lastly the Zemeckis directed motion capture version (2009) is criminally underrated. The animation complements the horror of the story in a way that live action can't really do. It makes me wish more version stuck with Dickens's depiction of the Ghost of Christmas Past being a candle.   Anyway, what do you all think? What are your favorite versions of this story?"

They're childhood classics for me and I can enjoy the overall feel in each because I think they're well balanced as opposed to the rest.   His incessant need to assert that he's quirky and ✨so random✨and curly q with every single teeny tiny detail is wild. Not everything has to be stylized and in his weird, hideous version of avant garde in yet he's been at the same unremarkable crap for nearly 40 years. Makes me feel serious secondhand embarrassment.

The chief complaints of the movie are always: it was too long too slow could have used some editing 4. Longer doesn't mean better, editors exist for a reason  Some Examples:.  Avengers: Endgame 3:01.  The Batman 2:56.  Avatar: Way of Water 3:12.  Black Panther: Wakanda Forever 2:41.  Elvis 2:39.  Eternals 2:36.  No time to die 2:43.   That's just random examples of some of the highest grossing movies of the last couple years.  The impetus for this post is that my girlfriend didn't want to go see Avatar or Wakanda Forever because they were too long. We have the AMC movie pass, so it's not like it even costs her anything besides time. I've happily watched plenty of very long movies, many more than once, but I don't understand why studios greenlight such long scripts.   Side note: Artistically I totally understand the necessity for long movies, but most Blockbusters are hardly art. I would gladly have longer movies to avoid travesties like the studio cut of Justice League or Once Upon a Time in America,"

When I first watched this movie I figured the idea was the donkey represented Padraic because he was being stubborn but wasn't quite sure about how the dog would fit in so I let the theory go. But this time around I realized I had it backwards. The donkey represents *Colm* and the dog, *Padraic*. And I started to see the complexities of their dynamic explored in these two animals and how they're treated.  These two men have a very specific and not super conventional relationship at least compared to most western, modern day sensibilities. They live on a small island, it's hard to avoid one another let alone avoid anyone at all. They don't entirely make a great pair, like the bartender pointed out, but without time, enough boredom, and enough alcohol, any two people can become friends of some sort.  And yet despite that these two men truly need each other. They're both lonely, at the end of the day. We see that Padraic doesn't really have a whole lot of friends aside from Colm. He hangs out with Dominic but really only out of pity and because he's sad. When he's at the pub there isn't really anyone else for him to sit with, despite the rest of the village thinking he's a nice man. He's likable but there maybe isn't quite as much substance there, hence the dull comment by Colm.   It's similar to Colm's dog. Anyone can like a dog, but dogs are generally seen as not very smart. Though this is a border collie, which may be important specifically because of the fact that Colm doesn't have any sheep. A border collie *isn't* stupid, they're actually rather smart for a dog, and yet he's not ever used the way a border collie is meant to be used. He's simply around to keep Colm company.   Colm seems more popular on the surface but really most of his popularity has to do with his music. He's made a small name for himself making music to the point of attracting mainlanders to come and play with him, and 'the ladies love him' but seemingly only when he's playing music so they can sing with him. Almost any time Colm is not playing music, he's at home, smoking alone, save for the one scene at the beginning when he's getting a drink before Padraic comes in.   The donkey, conversely, explicitly has something that it does. Padraic makes a living off his farm animals, they have 'substance' so to speak, and yet they aren't just farm animals to him. He cares about the donkey beyond how a farmer might care for their donkey, even letting him into the house when his sister tells him not to. The donkey is Colm, not only because he's obviously stubborn but because perhaps Padraic is the only one on the island who cares about Colm *beyond what he can provide* - his music.  Colm likes Padraic for the comfort he provides, and maybe just simply for the entertainment, hence why he says he kind of likes him after he makes a scene the one night in the bar, but ultimately he also just doesn't want him to speak. He just wants Padraic to give him unconditional affection without him talking to him, and to entertain him from time to time, but he doesn't care about Padraic's needs, abilities, or wants, really. He's completely stuck in his own head.   We see he loves his dog for the same reasons he supposedly hates Padraic, but the dog doesn't speak. In fact his dog never whines, or even barks once in the whole movie. I think this is to represent the dichotomy of him liking Padraic when he's drunk, when he's maybe more able to look past the 'dullness', vs. having to deal with the real Padraic when they're sober or when he's buried in his despair and can't see the good in him or the reason he likes him. But he doesn't want to admit that, he thinks the only thing that defines him is his music, and that Padraic - and by extension comfort or self love - is holding him back. He pushes away Padraic because maybe he doesn't think he deserves that kind of love, or people who are nice, despite clearly still needing it as we see by the way he treats his dog. The contrast of how he treats Padraic vs how he treats his dog illustrates this. He likes what Padraic can give to him but he doesn't want to indulge him, because that would mean needing to be considerate of *his* feelings, not what he can provide him. We see this with the wagon scene. Colm's ultimatum didn't mean that he never wanted to spend any time with him, he is *specifically* asking him just to not speak to him anymore. When Padraic has been beaten by the policeman, Colm doesn't hesitate to scoop him up and take him on the wagon back home. Not only does this illustrate he still cares it shows how their relationship survives in silence. There's a possibility they would still have had some manner of relationship if Padraic never spoke, but the *moment* Padraic starts crying, once Colm has to confront Padraic having feelings and being his own person, he stops and gets off. He doesn't want to or maybe isn't able to deal with Padraick's feelings, only the closeness and warmth he provides him. It would also mean indulging with things that he's scared are wasting time, even though he likely still enjoyed doing them. He expects Padraic to be able to just put up with this absurd ultimatum, because he wants Padraic to be like his dog. Quiet. Obedient. But somehow still happy. He thinks he's stupider than he really is, so he expects it to be an easy ask because why would a dog care? A dog would just go off an find another person to pet him and play with. However in his stubbornness and depression, Colm doesn't realize that the *reason* Padraic is so happy is because of his relationship with Colm.  Colm accidentally killing the donkey illustrates this I think. The fact that it was an accident is a deliberate choice. This isn't a malicious character. He's sad, he's old, he's scared of death, but he doesn't wish any harm on Padraic, he just has a misguided idea of who he wants to be. He doesn't realize what he's doing to Padraic or how hard of an ask it is. He doesn't realize what his relationship means to Padraic because he doesn't really think much of him, he just uses him for the comfort. So the donkey accidentally choking on his fingers feels like it represents the way he didn't expect the ultimatum to have such an effect. For one, the donkey dying represents Colm's talents dying because he can no longer play his music. He knew this was a possible outcome of course but I don't think he really wanted it, and maybe he felt even if it does at least it might give him something to add to his legacy, or maybe deep down he wanted to see if people still wanted to be around him if he could no longer provide something for them. Secondly, it represents the final severance of their relationship. Colm is dead to Padraic, afterwards. And I don't think that was ever the intention. Again, I think in his fear, despair, and arrogance, Colm thought Padraic would be able to just adjust to them not being friends fine and it not hurt him, but he didn't realize just how much he meant to Padraic.   And yet the dog lives. Padraic isn't dead to him. Deep down Colm still likes Padraic. He just doesn't want to admit it, because to him he feels like that would mean he is okay with just enjoying life instead of doing something important that leaves a legacy. He isn't able to let himself do that. It's either be a great musician who's remembered by many or be a great friend who's remembered by few. There isn't room in his head for both those outcomes."

A lot of movies have extended editions or directors cuts that have very few changes like a extra joke or something. There are some that can change the pacing of the movies or an entirely different ending and  changes the viewers experience but get cut due to time restraints or other reasons. So what is your favorite director's cut/ extended version?   Me personally it's the Zack Snyder Justice League. The original theatre version was easily forgettable with little interesting scenes and dialogue but the recent Synder cut was a complete change introducing a better origin story for cyborg as his dad guided him on how to control his powers. Another favorite is the “Rouge Cut” from X-men Days of Future Past and Lord of the Rings. But what are yours"

But at the end of the day he was the king! It's hard to register how influential a figure like him was in his day.  I suppose I went in thinking this would be more like Walk the Line with Joaquin Phoenix. Maybe a little more pizzazz knowing a little bit of the director's work from the past. But for most of the film I wasn't sure what I was watching.  I have seen other comments on here saying it was made for the TikTok generation with how spastic the filming was. I feel as though the director made his style more of a character than Elvis himself. Butler's performance would have shined more brilliantly... or more accurately without the excessive editing.  I guess you can say larger than life figures like Elvis could use a style like Lurhmanns. But for me so much of the film was just cringy. It looked like it didn't have faith the modern audience would be interested and so it tried making it something more like a caricature of Elvis and not who he actually was.   I'm not sure how this film will hold up. But I can't help but think years from now. People will look back at the film to study the art direction of the director and less the subject matter. I think Elvis deserved better.  I guess I just wasn't prepared to see a hero of mine presented in such a way. Anyways, I guess I just needed a place to vent!"

The reason for that can be seen in Star Wars.  While Empire is certainly more action-packed, the first film was such a quantum leap in quality of space movies.  Its set and craft design was simply never seen before.  One could argue that Alien is also far and away better than Aliens.    Similarly Lost Ark is great as it introduces the universe.  But I wonder if Last Crusade measures up.  It doesn't really have any dead scenes.  We won't speak of the two other films that feature a sidekick.  They don't measure up.  But can it be said that Last Crusade is as good as, or even better than, the original?  EDIT:  I need to recognize Wrath of Khan is without a doubt a certain case of sequel > original.

Also why is every male character a pervert? Why does every female character lack personality?  Recently I watched Dumb & Dumber since it's a classic. I didn't hate it. There was some pretty good stuff in there, but the constant gross-out kind of made me roll my eyes a bit.   Then I watched Talladega Nights because I noticed it had positive reception and Will Ferrell is in it. I absolutely hated it. It's everything I can't stand about movies from this era, and I find it seriously overrated. I'm aware of the context of the film as well regarding NASCAR. It's just constant perverted shock value. I felt like I was watching a live action version of a bad modern Family Guy episode.  This isn't me being a puritan, I don't mind edgy humor. In fact, especially in today's time, I miss it, and I think we need it back (I disagree when people say Tropic Thunder and Blazing Saddles are dated). But it shouldn't be this incredibly juvenile. Gross out humor and perversion are such easy and cheap jokes that take little to no thought. It feels like a 13 year old wrote some of these scripts. They kind of age the film too imo.  Meanwhile, I find animated movies like Shrek 2, The Simpsons Movie, Emperor's New Groove, Madagascar 2, Kung Fu Panda, Ice Age, Bee Movie, Ratatouille, Toy Story, etc. to be far more timeless and hilarious in comparison. I get the sense that smart people who cared were writing these and TRYING, rather than having the comedians improvise scenes or cheapening things out. Usually the gross out in these films were incredibly minimal (there'd usually be like one joke and not several), and because they're forced to be family movies, the male characters aren't massive pervs. I even find a lot of the female characters in these movies more identifiable and interesting as well. I also find some, but very few, modern animated comedies like Wish Dragon and The Bob's Burgers Movie to be just as good.  I even find Beavis & Butthead: Do America, and South Park: Bigger Longer & Uncut to utilize the previous tropes I criticized better. In Beavis & Butthead: Do America, the well-thought out stupidity in every scenario overshadows the pervertedness of the protagonists (it also clearly establishes that not every guy in this world is gross. Beavis & Butthead are intentionally supposed to be the minority, and unnormal). And the South Park movie's shock, at the very least, is more nuanced with its satirical themes of censorship, and the characters have a broader charm.  Animated shows from this era, which have more diverse protagonists, are even better and funnier too!"

Whether they be shorts or full length, animated or live action, YouTube (yes, I have seen all of DUST's productions)  or whatever else. Basically, I am starved for a good space flick and if it's on IMBD's top 100, maybe even like 200, or whatever, I have most likely seen it. So if anyone could suggest me really anything, I would be SUPER thankful!"

        "body": "While many critics have claimed this film is about cancel culture, that narrative is incredibly reductive to the broader themes of the film.  Lydia Tar is presented as an absolute power in the beginning of the movie, in complete control like a conductor who controls an orchestra. She speaks with an air of complete authority, confident and verbose, pulling from a million different references. When a naive but we'll meaning young conductor tries to push back she pounces on his apparent inexperience, using his mention of Varese as an opportunity to prove she knows more. In a brilliant oner that blends Tar's eloquent verbal barbs with the prowess of the direction of the scene. When this scene is shown later in the hatchet job form, the one take and her verbal performance are mangled, the self she was attempting to present obliterated.  We should talk about the self because that is one of the main things this film is about. The films opening narrative thrust is the anticipation of completing Mahler's fifth symphony. While there are many more popular composers within the classical canon, there are few as heavily mythologized as Mahler (probably Wagner, maybe Beethoven). It's hard to explain what exactly I mean, there is something so maximalist and dense about his music, much like Wagner's, that it instills for many a feeling akin to spirituality. This is helped by various factors such as the time Mahler lived in, the height of classical music's social power, and Mahler's own tragic life, which leads to many interpreting his works through the lens of his life, something Tar herself mentions. The main thing to get at though, is that the classical canon is already heavily mythologized, lines are drawn on retrospect to connect everything together in a linear path from Palestrina to Shostakovich. This canon starts to fall apart throughout the 20th century due to the more limited range of music exploding into a thousand styles of impressionist, expressionist, post romantic, serialist, nationalist, avant garde, modernist, post modernist, spectralist, etc. not to mention the popularusic that erupted at that time. Mahler epitomizes this very manufactured mythology, and not only as a composer but as a conductor. Up until Mahler's time the conductor was still not given nearly as much power as they would be after him, and to a degree were still mostly concerned with keeping rhythm, even Mahler's contemporary Richard Strauss, an esteemed conductor, had a fairly straightforward approach to the form. Something about Mahler's more expressive conducting became an inspiration for the idea of the conductor as a translator of the music for the audience.  Tar is aware of this.  When asked in a subtle way to justify her role, her importance, she goes on a long tangent that ends up approximating because I understand the music better, I hold the secrets that none else do and only I can deliver them effectively. This is her creating her own mythology. She is surrounded by people who have reinforced, and to whom she has reinforced, said mythology until she begins to believe it herself.  Towards the end when Bernstein talks about how music is how it makes you feel seems so far removed from her esoteric analysis, and this is not to say her analysis are not without value.That is what makes Tar interesting, like many famous artists who were horrible people, she is good at what she does, but the point is that she is too concerned with proving how good she is at what she does that she has lost sight of the reason she loved music in the first place by the time she reached her peak. The tragedy of this film is not her downfall, that was only the predictable results of hubris. No, the real tragedy was an artist who loved art, who become so sebsumed within her own ego that she began to believe that she was the art. It's ironic the one thing she struggled completely at was composition, the part of music requiring pure creation, not interpretation. She uses many lengthy sentences to describe why past music is so important, but I suspect, in part from the VHS of Lenny, the biggest reason is nostalgia and the power nostalgia music can create, and that is where her fixation lies. At one point I believe she refers to music as the closest experience to the divine or something to that effect. In that sense then, she has become a god to herself.  This is what jutified all the hypocritical and monstrous things she did, blacklisting Krista and trying to hide the evidence, using her power to gain sexual favors, regularly belittling those she viewed as beneath her, which by the start of the film seemed to be nearly everyone. Because she believed her own mythology she felt free to manipulate others because she was so close to the divine morality was inapplicable to her. However, it's worth noting this self mythologizing blinded her to the ways in which she was actually being manipulated simultaneously, such as by the cello player who drops her once she has what she wants, nor is she as aware of the way in which her transactional relationships require a transaction from her, leading to mistakes rooted in presumptuousness. However by the end of the film she is reduced to nothing, her self mythology obliterated, and in her humiliation she is forced to see herself unshrouded in the mists of ego. Her experience in the massage brothel forces her to confront how her relationships in exchange for favors have been in no different than choosing a girl from a fishbowl. Her being forced to play with a click track for a gaming convention is brutal in how it reduces her role to that of a visual metronome, unable to at all manipulate time which she talked so much about earlier in the film.  Now there's is one other big theme this all ties into. Tar is a critique of auteur theory. The film opens with the full credits, showing the full range of people who created it, not letting the audience leave at the end of the movie as they roll. In many ways auteur directors are quite similar to conductors, conductors are even often referred to as music directors. They orchestrate a large number of people with separate skills to one single goal, and this are similarly mythologized, but as many people through the years have pointed out, are rarely in direct control of every aspect of a film, and disproportionate credit towards them can and frequently does diminish the roles of the countless other artists and workers that create their own works wholly from their own skill. Similarly, conductors tend to be placed in the spotlight and paid disproportionate amounts of money, and a performance's quality is frequently mainly credited towards them.   Tar is a great conductor, the film makes that abundantly clear, but what it also makes, especially with the ending, is that the performance can and will go on without her. Though she is able to give many ideas to the musicians as a whole, the musicians ultimately are the ones who's skill are required to realize her ideas, they are the ones with the means of production. And like with any transactional relationships couched in a severe power dynamic, of that sort, she needs them to believe her mythology more than they need her to direct their capabilities."

        "body": "The new Puss in Boots is already showing here in my country and I gotta say, I loved it. Not quite at the heights of Shrek and Shrek 2 but it's easily third best and in that conversation. It delivers the madcap and irreverent energy we love from Shrek, plus gorgeous animation, inventive action and plenty of heart to boot.   The gags never stop coming, with many delightful riffs on fairy tales, nursery rhymes and other classic stories. John Mulaney as Little Jack Horner is having the most fun here, and the movie plays as if they worked around his improvising (a la Robin Williams in Aladdin). There is a riff on a Pinocchio character that is completely bizarre yet hysterically funny, not least because of the absolutely perfect voice acting decision.  Of course, the film's foundation is the Puss in Boots character. Puss remains a delightful and endlessly entertaining character, thanks to his exaggerated panache, Banderas' spirited delivery, and the hilarious contrast between bravado and adorable kitty cutesiness.   Just like the early Shrek movies, this has some very funny pop culture references. By this I mean that it's not lazily winking at other movies for cheap nostalgia, but adapting imagery to its fantasy setting in ways that are surprising and stylish.   I mean it when I say this is gorgeous, with a new visual language not seen in previous Shrek films. Like Into the Spiderverse and The Bad Guys, the film uses cel shaded models and has 2D textures and effects incorporated into the 3D environments. This creates a cartoonish look wherein characters are more expressive and the environments more dynamic. Elsewhere, during action sequences, characters will leap between frames, compressing space and time to create an exhilarating and swashbuckling pace. Above all else the direction is filled with stylish choices, my favourite being characters' expressions revealed in the reflections of swinging weapons.  Although the plot doesn't always unfold naturally alongside the character beats, all in all this is a rollicking good time with a fun script, loveable main character, and spectacular direction.   For me it's a 9/10 and I think it will emerge as many folks' best animated film of the year."

I've been thinking about how this doesn't use the conventional tropes as most movies, and I'm wondering what other films do something similar? David Lynch is almost known primarily for his singular language, but in particular Eraserhead just does it's own thing. Very little dialogue, very few characters, and the main supporting character is deliberately hideous to create distance between the two characters, but also between the viewer ad the baby.  Breaking the fourth wall is also an example of this. However, in Funny Games the antagonist does more than just break the fourth wall, he actively disrupts the timeline of the movie in a way that even usurps the traditional fourth wall breaking.  Can you suggest any other movies that don't  use the conventional language of cinema?"

        "title": "Top 5 Horror Remakes IMHO ",
        "index": "0   1 2      3       4    ",
        "body": "First of all, I'm not a fan of movie remakes. That being said, I usually do love horror remakes and in this article I'm going to talk about my top 5. I'm not making this a countdown to the best because for a couple of them I couldn't decide which was better. Instead I'll be listing them in the order they were released (the best one still ended up at the end, haha).  THE RING (2002)  Directed by Gore Verbinski and written by Ehren Kruger, The Ring, was based on the Japanese horror film by Hiroshi Takahashi and it ended up being a monster. Lead by, Naomi Watts, the cast included Martin Henderson, David Dorfman, Jane Alexander, and Brian Cox. From the opening moments it took us on a journey of terror that I rarely feel watching a movie. Seeing Samara crawl out of that well, then out of the television made me uncomfortable, not to mention the hidden Easter egg included on the DVD release where you could actually watch “the video” for yourself. I did, and at the time my home phone ringer sounded exactly like the one they played in the hidden feature. Talk about instantly regretting my decision. Watch a video and the phone rings, the voice on the other end tells you, you will die in seven days, and people did. Sifting through the clues was part of the fun of the movie, discovering every layer of the greater mystery that was The Ring. The film today has a 71% on Rotten Tomatoes, and grossed $249.3 million, not bad for a PG-13 horror release. If you haven't seen it, for whatever reason, you should. I can't recommend it enough.  THE TEXAS CHAINSAW MASSACRE (2003)  Directed by Marcus Nispel and Written by Scott Kosar, The Texas Chainsaw Massacre was based on the original of the same name from, Kim Henkel and Toby Hooper. This was one, at the time, that I was not looking forward to seeing. The original is a horror classic and number one on several lists of greatest horror movies of all time. The cast, lead by, Jessica Biel, and featuring, Johnathan Tucker, Erica Leerhsen, Mike Vogel, Eric Balfour, and R Lee Ermey, all turned in amazing performances. I was pleasantly surprised that I ended up liking this remake as much as I did, I put it right up there with the original. The gore was hard to watch but that was the point, the kills were fun and original, the ending was unexpected for the most part, spoiler alert, Leatherface loses an arm! All that being said the creepiest part of this movie is still the little boy. I can see him licking his teeth in my nightmares. The movie is fun and entertaining and is very worthy of a watch or two. The critics at the time however did NOT agree with me. The movie stands at 37% on Rotten Tomatoes, and grossed just $107.4 million at the box office.  THE HILLS HAVE EYES (2006)  Directed by Alexandre Aja from a script by Alexandre Aja and Gregory Levasseur, The Hills Have Eyes was a shot in the arm for a genre that had been lacking for a couple of years. Based on the original by the master of horror, Wes Craven, this remake broke a lot of rules. With a cast that included, Aaron Stanford, Kathleen Quinlan, Vanessa Shaw, Emilie de Ravin, Dan Byrd, Robert Joy, and Ted Levine, the majority of this horror fest took place in broad daylight. Yes, there were scenes at night when awful and terrible things happened but most of this film (including the amazing climax) all took place during the day. No one could hide in the shadows, we all knew exactly what the “hero” was facing because the “monsters” (a family horribly mutated by nuclear fallout) were lit by the sun in the middle of the desert! If you have yet to watch it, I do recommend it, it's an amazing horror ride. I will say there is more than one very uncomfortable scene so tread at your own risk. The film was panned by critics, holding only a 52% on Rotten Tomatoes and it didn't earn much money, only $70 million but it made up for it in video sales, garnering a pretty large cult following.  EVIL DEAD (2013)  Directed by Fede Alvarez and written by Fede Alvarez and Rodo Sayagues, the Evil Dead remake took the concept of the original and turned it up to eleven. Based on the original by Sam Raimi, a film that could have used the kind of money this one had, Fede took everything we liked about Sam's film to the next level. Sam Raimi and Bruce Campbell even believed in this re-imagining so much, they produced it themselves. The cast included, Jane Levy, Shiloh Fernandez, Lou Taylor Pucci, Jessica Lucas, and Elizabeth Blackmore and they made the unbelievable happenings of the flick seem like they were really happening. It was gross, it was scary, it was uncomfortable, it was even funny at times, this movie was everything that it needed to be. At this point it goes without saying (because it wouldn't be on my list if I didn't think you should watch it) but you really need to see this movie if you haven't. It's a fun trip that wastes no time getting right into the action. You won't be bored. This is another film with a low Rotten Tomatoes score, only 63% and it only pulled in $97.5 million but I'm telling you, pick a night and see for yourself.  ​IT (2017)  Directed by Andy Muschietti and written by Chase Palmer, Cary Fukunaga and Gary Dauberman, IT was worth the wait. If you've made it this far then you know I set it up by saying the best was last, and in my opinion, IT is definitely the top of this crop. Based more on the book by Stephen King (is that cheating my premise?) than it was the 90's mini series starring Tim Curry, this movie really had it all—scares, touching character moments and growth, terror, mystery—it's a great film let alone an amazing horror film. The cast was lead by Jaeden Liebherher as Bill Denbrough and Bill Skarsgard as the inter-dimensional monster known as Pennywise the clown and both of them do an amazing job respectfully. This movie has some of the most disturbing imagery I've seen on screen and there are certain parts I think of almost daily. If you haven't watched it yet then you really need to make that happen, and make sure you can follow it up with Chapter 2 because it's one long story spanning the years in Derry Maine. The critics and basically everyone else agree with me on this one, it has a solid 86% on Rotten Tomatoes and made a whopping $701.8 million worldwide, setting pretty as the highest grossing horror movie of all time.  So that's it, my top 5 horror remakes, let me know if you agree or disagree, if I made a mistake or somehow overlooked something you think should be here. These are some of my favorite horror films and I think if you haven't seen one or any of them…you need to fix that.  Twitter/Instagram | CrockettForReal"

It could be a very disturbing topic of cannibalism, it could be the genre of the road-movie, with characters constantly being on the move. I often felt like I am watching something staged, even surrealistic and at times almost grotesque. It didn't feel real, in spite of all of the intended realism, and, hence, left me cold. The shocking factor didn't work too somehow. It looked like a disturbing fairytale to me. What are your thoughts about Luca's most recent movie?   P.S. Taylor Russell is really talented.

I don't think people who liked thoses movies are wrong   The Star Wars prequels.I had never seen Star Wars before that and had high expectations, based on people talking of Star Wars in such high regards, and wow, they get worse every time i watch them. On the other hand, the Original Trilogy is not only my favourite trilogy of all time, its the best imo (and i don't like the Sequel trilogy either but at least everything on screen is not computer generated)  Die Hard 4. Die Hard 3 happens to be my favourite movie of all time and boy was i disappointed on this one. I think only McTiernian understand and can handle Die Hard  Godfather Trilogy. It was good yeah but i didn't saw the masterpieces in the first 2 movies and the 3rd, the least i say the better (Sofia Coppola is the worst actress i have ever seen perform  The Blair Witch Project. Half a disappointement, people praises it so much as the scariest movie ever, i felt disappointed when i saw absolutely nothing happening from beggining to end (i've heard it was a it or miss for a lot of people back then) and after i was thinking about it and if you consider its the 2 guys doing everything from the beggining then its really frightening."

        "body": "The Middle Earth movies are my favourite media series: I like all the entries, and across all six of them (no, The Rings of Power doesn't count) I feel there's the best unity across entries, being that all of them were made - uniquely - by the same writer/director and the same creative team.  That being said, I always embark on a rewatching of the cycle a little wary: the first film in the order of the narrative, *The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey,* is in fact my least favourite. So, now that it just turned a decade old, I think its time to square off with this film, why I like it, what about it I don't like and how it stands within the cycle as a whole.  I think its possibly the most visually rapturous of the six films: Andrew Lesnie's high-definition cinematography is crystal-clear and pin-sharp, and Jackson in his second venture to Middle Earth is willing to let takes hold longer (a 90-second oner in two different scales took two days to film). The result is that Middle Earth is on fine display: from New Zealand's verdant and vertiginous landscapes to Dan Hennah's meticulous sets of Dale, Erebor, Hobbiton and so forth: For all the complaints of CGI, the constructed environments are spacious and lavish. The movie belies scale at every turn, like David Lean's old adage about movie opera - it even has a praghiera scene - the deeply stirring Misty Mountains ensemble - that would not have been out of place on the Parisian stage in the 1850s!  At the same time, I think the issue is the rate in which the environments that make this dazzling tableaux pass by, which is too slow. The film has a deterimental pacing issue: its not so much the length of the setup which, at 44 minutes, is actually quite short. Rather, its the fact that once the company is on the road...the quest almost immediately stalls for the sake of a flashback to the Battle of Moria - which is very important to the psyche of one of our main characters, and to the story as the film sets-it up - and to a cutaway to Rhosgobel (again, very important going forward) and to an episodic adventure involving three Trolls, none of which gets us any closer to Erebor and the Dragon.  Now, many first entries have pacing issues because they need to get the piece off of the ground: Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone basically had no conflict until a good 90 minutes in, which is longer than here. The first Season of The Rings of Power show was excruciatingly slow. The issue here, however, is that it clashes with what author Ian Nathan calls the bawdry tone of the film.  And this is really the core of the film, and the source of both its strength and weaknesses: An Unexpected Journey is the satyr-play of the Middle Earth cycle. It seems, says Ian, that Jackson is sending himself off when the Dwarves irreverently trash his beloved Bag-End or temper with the pomposity of his finely-cast Elves. Even the Dwarves themselves are the image of the satyr chorus: hairy, stount, virile and indignant.  I personally think its an inspired choice: the comedic tone could only work for the very beginning of the cycle, and it fits the idea that we are here revisiting Middle Earth at a time of relative peace, indeed on the eve of Sauron's ressurgence. This way, there's room for the later entries - both in The Hobbit but also The Lord of the Rings itself - to get consistently darker, which they indeed do.  At the same time, it does heighten the pacing problem. So much so that (even though I watch the film in 2D) I put an intermission into the movie at the same point that the 3D had it: right after Azog is revealed on Weathertop. Its a fine place to pause and, that way, returning from intermission the White Council sequence feels like a more naturally-placed exposition dump rather than stopping the movie dead in its tracks.  The segment of the movie that follows is thankfully the film at its strongest: a lot of it has to do with the dizzying rate in which the setpieces are dolled-out: Rivendell, rain all but pelting the audience's faces in the high pass, torch-fires licking at their faces in the rickety Goblintown, rustling pine-trees in their ears in the Forest Ledge and alpine air of the New Zealand skies, in one of the series' most sublimely romantic moments. Of particular note, too, is a standout scene with Gollum, which Jackson wisely and boldly chose NOT to intercut with the Goblintown scenes.  But, as per usual, the true core to the success of the film's second part is in its character interactions: they become more concentrated and therefore more focused. As much as the film is about Bilbo (Martin Freeman) finding his place among the company, its about the Dwarves - those lovable satyrs - accepting Bilbo into their ranks. There is a pair of confrontations - Bilbo and Bofur, followed by Bilbo and Thorin - cleverly constructed to mirror each other, which serve to underline this basic thrust of the movie very artfully and which all these years later I still find deeply moving and affecting. 7/10"

They get across the initial conflict, give an idea of where the escalation starts and sets-up both the protag- and antagonists in a satisfying way. No more questions, your honour.   This new trailer feels twice as long, shows some of the same footage, and adds a TON of unnecessary plotlines, story beats, jump scares, and late-stage footage to show the viewers a recap of the whole thing.

One perspective could be from DB Cooper and Tina Mucklow, the flight attendant who had most contact with him. Cooper calms down several irritated passengers, has friendly conversations with Mucklow and even jokes with her a few times. He cooperates with the flight crew and harms no-one (except the bank, of course).

The actual story of this is really sad when you think about it. It wouldn't have taken a ton of work to turn this into a tragedy like Death of a Salesman or something. Seeing a guy who's never anything but kind to anyone get repeatedly kicked in the proverbial ass is heartbreaking, and even though it takes its time to set all this up, Capra and Stewart really create an immensely sympathetic protagonist.  And at the end when he's finally repaid and can enjoy his life with his family, it's so immensely satisfying. Even though less than half of it is actually set at Christmas, the themes of generosity and kindness are so powerful that it really is a great holiday film.  Also Mr. Potter is public enemy number one. The man literally steals thousands of dollars from a struggling family just to have George arrested for shits and giggles. Even Scrooge wasn't that blatantly malicious."

I feel like TGM, Shawshank & then The Mist but man, do they have some great climaxes. The Mist is still one of my favorite horror films, Thomas Jane was so good in that, possibly my favorite role of his even though I really liked him in The Punisher (2004) & Deep Blue Sea (1999).

In Ralph Breaks the Internet the villain was a creepily insecure Ralph who misunderstood friendship.  In Frozen II the villain was someone who kicked the bucket decades prior and the protagonists are just dealing with the fallout (technically no misunderstanding).  In Raya and the Last Dragon the villain was a misunderstood brainwashed friend of the protag who apparently doesn't know what's right from wrong at 18.  In Encanto the villain is a misunderstood family member who realizes their mistake and makes up for it in thr course of 5 minutes.  In Strange World the villains are laughable squid like wusses and pink pieces of shit who were all just revealed to be fucking misunderstood.  What the fuck happened to Disney's great villains of yore who were both memorable and intimidating? Would Disney today even greenlight a villain like Claude Frollo?

So, bringing Aliens into the picture made it bad for most people...even though the aliens were worshipped as gods. Still technically biblical.  And people also complain about how the movie looks. Like why is the movie so bright and with a white tint? It's because they wanted to copy the way they made movies in that era, which is pretty clever actually, but no one liked it.     And everyone hates Shia Lebouf and I have no idea why. I did read about that he copied an already existing script word for word and that's why people hate him. I guess you can hate him as a person, but as an actor and the movies that he has been in have been good films. I Robot, Constantine, the Transformers trilogy, Fury, I thought were all pretty good. And him starring in these movies did not ruin the films, unlike how most people think that that is the case.  Everyone's excuses are pretty dumb. I think they just hate just because they want to. Just like what happened before the Morbius movie came out. Everyone made memes of it because they knew that it would fail. The movie wasn't that bad, but everyone memed the shit out of it.

So, did the military just not test whether the anti-matter cannon could destroy entire planets? Because it seems like if they have a planet-killing weapon that the idea of destroy entire planets is not too far of a stretch of a use for the weapon… So, if the military wanted to drive the aliens to extinction, why not, just like, simply destroy their planet by pressing a single button? Why the convoluted hassle of gas lighting a child in military camp and trick him into playing video games.  If anything, they put the entire mission at risk by letting a child sacrifice thousands of personnel without as much as knowing the scope of the mission or the weapon's capabilities…  It is a great movie.

So I share my opinion with you to see if it's all in my head or if you think like me.  I've always been bored with the parts of a film that talk about intense love stories, and above all I've always been bored with films that revolve completely around a love story.  Personally I am part of that new generation where romantic relationships are non-existent and sex is a completely hedonistic pleasure. I'm not complaining, but I also think that intense relationships could be a good experience as well and it's a shame that I can't understand them.  In this film, however, I can appreciate the relationship between the two, because unlike other films, the love story between the two characters is not put there to give meaning to the plot, but it is the film that gives meaning to the relationship, making it the key to everything. Basically Donnie initially lived to the accident just to get to know the girl and then as the relationship progressed the esotericism in the film became more and more significant up to the final part where they had sex and the world ended for Donnie by making him kill the real frank, in such a way as to make possible all that happened and return to the parallel world where he dies.  Virtually all the esotericism of the film is connected to the love story making it actually exciting because it is full of meaning, instead of as is usually done where it is the love story that makes the whole film exciting just because it should be significant in itself since we are human and we like these things trivially.  Ultimately I love this movie because it managed to get me excited about a love story, somehow making it more important than it is.  What do you think?"

He had a troubled relationship with his parents from what I'm gathering.   I also think he was terrified of getting too close to people. He usually only spent a week or two with people and then left. Probably goes back to the issues with his parents. But I think what he needed and what he was actually searching for was deep connection with others. It's a shame he was too scared to invest in that. I think he even realized that himself right before he died. Remember one of the last things he wrote was “happiness is only real when shared.” It's a shame he realized it too late.  Remember the old man at the end, Mr. Francis? Chris had a golden opportunity to form a meaningful, lifelong connection that they both desperately needed but he was very hesitant. I wonder, how would things have turned out if he'd survived Alaska and spent more time with Mr. Frances after and maybe met a woman to settle down with.  Another interesting angle is the fact that his death is the main thing that has brought relevancy to his story. His sister said that if he were still alive he probably wouldn't understand what all the fuss was about. He was simply on a journey to find happiness and fulfillment for himself.

It's also up there for one of the most tragic movies I've ever seen. So many scenes looking back that are absolutely heartbreaking.  The saddest scene for me is easily the scene where Michael hugs fredo at their mothers wake. Michael enters and fredo glances up with such the saddest look on his face, like a dog with his tail between his legs who knows his owner is upset with him. Then Michael goes closer to embrace fredo, and fredo grabs Michael as tight as he can. Just watching fredo embrace his brother so tightly, thinking he has a brother again, and knowing what happens later, is heartbreaking. It brings me to tears just to watch.   Then you have Michael with the coldest look in his eyes, like there's nothing behind them. He glances at his associate, who both know what will happen to fredo after the wake. Then it cuts to fredos arms grabbing Michael, and he grabs tighter and tighter. He has so much love for his brother and it's like his life is complete again. Meanwhile Michael feels nothing.  There's so much going on in such a short scene, so much emotion. And the score being played is immaculate. Easily my favorite and most heartbreaking scene in the whole movie.   What's your favorite part of this movie? I could talk about it for hours."

When Marvel first started to roll out the idea of an extended universe (I literally had no idea who the Avengers were until someone mentioned it after the 1st Captain America), I started to learn more about the larger universe.   One of the constant comments I've heard about why DCEU has failed miserably while Marvel has flourished is that Marvel is connected to the real world and real world issues (NYC gets demolished, X-Men is an allegory to the civil rights movement, etc.). Beyond the artistic development of making it lighter and all that other jazz, the DCEU seems to have a very big disadvantage in that their superheroes are simply too powerful it seems.   As opposed to Spiderman, the X-Men, Iron Man, and Captain America who start off with very grounded villains before they go off into space, it seems as though DC heroes really have no capacity for that. Other than Batman, all of them are essentially gods and so the only true villain can be other gods - which of course feels like a reinforcement that Batman would be the most popular since it's the most grounded in its story.   So for those who are more deeply knowledgeable about the DC comics, what does a successful DCEU look like? What does DC have to do to keep the story grounded to make them more relatable while their most popular and/or notable heroes are gods amongst men who need gods to defeat them?"

This applies to all art/ things that are made to elicit an emotional response or entertain.

Now, the movie isn't something very special, but it does happen to have some excellent acting. For fans of Jessica Chastain & Eddie, this features some of their best work. I couldn't believe The Good Nurse sold me the easily likable Eddie Redmayne as a creepy, suspicious looking dude.  Aside from the performances, the drama was alright. The stakes were established very early on and the only question that remained from the start was the 'why' of the murders.  It the disappointment of some, we don't exactly get the answer to the 'why' of it but it is based on a true story and the culprit in real life never gave the reason as well.  But as the movie ended, I felt the why isn't always necessary. Some people just want to watch the world burn or their intentions/thinking are so complex that the answers are always too complicated to distill into a few minutes in a movie.  The Good Nurse is an above average movie carried hard by the performances & nice direction."

The movie then shifts to modern day and people end up in this area maybe to go camping or exploring and come across the tent and the equipment with the machete still stuck in the post and they question it but soon they start to get picked off. They are getting hunted by something similar to the predator.

I was interested in people's thoughts on the tendency for sci-fi to lean toward the serious and the dramatic."

I read that the box office did pretty well, especially for the first one, and they both were generally acclaimed. People are eager to know what's on that infamous page 47.  What did really happen that made it so hard to make this a trilogy, or even a franchise?"

The conversation goes much the same, but then after Toby's family leaves, both men realize there's nothing left to do but get on with it:  Toby watched the car leave the drive, the setting sun fading in and out of his peripheral vision as the movement of the pumpjack briefly obscured it, then let it shine through again. He closed his eyes, letting the light dance orange and red through the lashes. He slowly reached down, clicking off the shotgun's safety.  Slowly turning back toward Marcus, he sighed. “Well…”  He felt the warmth seeping from his chest before he even registered the two shots still echoing across the flat.  “Shit.”  Marcus stood there, a look of concern spreading across his face. “I expected you'd turn the other direction. I missed my spot a little bit. Sorry bout that.”  Toby grunted in pain and let out a bitter laugh. “Ain't that just my luck.” He fell to a knee, then flat on his back in the grass, looking at the sky through tears.  “Fuck. This hurts.”  “I know son. Breathe through it. Won't be too long.”  Marcus pulled out his cell phone and  started to dial 911.  “What you gonna tell 'em?” Toby gurgled.  “What happened,” Marcus choked out, pulling a tobacco pipe as the dispatcher answered. He gave the address, packed and lit the pipe. “They'll deal with me, I don't intend to fight it.”  Marcus looked down at the younger man dying in the grass of his childhood home.  “Your boys'll be fine. I'll see to it nobody messes with 'em out here.”  “Thanks,” Toby said, “they're better off anyway. Never….thought I was gonna get away with this. Never meant for people to -“  “I know, son,” Marcus said, lightly touching Toby's arm as he struggled to draw final breath. “I know.”  Final shot pans out over the horizon as we see two police cars and an ambulance racing toward the house with lights and sirens blaring. Credits roll."

So the only things you should criticize or praise about a movie that matters is both the cinematic and storytelling aspects of it.  I'm not saying you can't have a personal opinion about movies. I'm just saying don't let personal biases and agendas cloud your judgement when the discussion comes up about which movie is best/better. My favourite movies are Catch Me If You Can (Cuz I imagine myself as the protagonist) and Warrior (cuz of my brother and I's relationship). But I can easily recognize Shawshank Redemption and Fight Club as the objectively superior ones. And I think more people should differentiate their critical and personal opinions about entertainment products and come with 2 lists.   It's probably why my most critically acclaimed movie era is the late 80s, 90s and early 00s. Think about Shawshank Redemption, Forrest Gump, Fight Club, Se7en, Scarface, Silence Of The Lambs, The Green Mile and American Psycho among others. They're movies that weren't too modern that they fall under the trope of prioritizing spectacle or... ugh.. politics.. over story and characters but they also aren't too old fashioned that people who watch them fall under the trope of the nostalgia dilemma. I get that you can have a weak spot for a movie because of your life situation at the time of watching them (like with me and Warrior) or your hype at the time when it came out due to it breaking new grounds with special effects and cinematography and that's all very fair. But it sucks that these technically bias views on pieces of art reduces or outright debunks the credibility of the simply better executed movies premises because critical acclaim isn't placed where it's due.  Anyways this was my rant. I would love to hear some of your thoughts on it."

The first movie only uses 5% of the book and got the title wrong. Literally the only things in this movie that are in the book is the plot, 3 of the 4 factory rooms and the dramatic boat ride. Everything else was entirely made up and did not exist in the book. And instead of a room of squirrels with bad nuts, it was a room of geese with bad eggs.  Even the author of the book that had to write the script for this movie hated all of the changes.        I grew up watching both movies and loved them both, and at the time I didn't know that there was a book. When I read the book when I turned 12, I realized that they got the title wrong for the first movie, but not the second one. Then when reading the book, I realized that the second movie was exactly like the book. And afterwards I wondered why the first movie failed so much. And what is weird is that everyone I talked to about the second movie, they thought that I was crazy that I thought it was good. Apparently, everyone loves the first movie and hates the second one. Did no one read the book? Did anyone know that there was a book? I don't entirely hate the first movie. Comparing it to the book and then back to the second movie...it is pretty bad, but as a fantasy movie for its time, I guess its ok.      So why does this movie get so much hate, but everyone loves Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory?     Also, I do agree that Gene Wilder was the better Willy Wonka, but his movie is not the best of the two."

Never in my life have I believed a movie relationship more than I did when watching this. When they meet it's not like this big oh my god I love her moment, it's just a little brief friendly moment between coworkers. And then as they start to spend more time together you slowly see both of them start to fall for each other and it just feels so goddamn real because of how Sandler and Barrymore sell it.   And this all comes to a head with the big finale, which by every possible metric should be just a massive eyeroll. It involves a chase-down at the airport and a big confession of love in a public setting, all things I'd normally laugh at but my eyes were glued to the TV because I just bought into this fake relationship so much.

I only recommend this if you've already seen the rest of the list that touches on the theme of horror in the style of the thing.  **Train to Busan**  A classic if you are looking for zombies, I would say the best, except that they did the live action at the Seoul station, it is much superior in narrative but sadly it was a very bad animation.  **Screamers 1995**  killer robots hiding among humans for a surprise attack.  **The horder 2009**  It feels more immersive due to its more realistic tone in American gang-style conversation, sadly the action is a bit poor compared to its dialogue.  **what we become**  trapped in their houses by the restrictions of the military, a lot of suspense very good, it feels like a thread that is always on the verge of breaking, a total recommendation if you are looking for something dramatic, but it has a small problem, I feel like it is missing something of action or to show more horror.  **Survival of the dead**  If you're looking for more of a military perspective, this is a great option. I think they achieved their goal well by the way they acted and the strategies used.  **The Wailing**  Wonderful movie, again the Asians making masterpieces, I can only say that the tension that this movie gives is good because almost at no time is it tension of persecution but of suspicions, it focuses a lot on rituals so for lovers of portelgeist this is it That is a great recommendation from me.  **Cloverfield**  The only handheld movie that was worth seeing for me, what a good movie that constant tension and when the monster comes out it was something spectacular like never before, seriously if you haven't seen it yet you should see it, it's excellent although the beginning is slow.  **Apocalypse disaster L.A**  If you want something within a city, this captures that feeling quite well, but there is a problem, it is that the special effects are bad and they hardly show any places, it shows that they did it in about 4 very closed places without the opportunity to record in the street But for the rest, if we talk about narrative and acting, it's pretty good, nothing spectacular, but it's passable.  **Seoul Station**  very, very bad animation, it's not the worst either since it has good work in the shadows and everything happens at night which helps to enjoy it, in general I recommend it because it has one of my favorite narratives in movies.  &#x200B;  **- others -**  &#x200B;  **1.** **Groundhog Day**  My favorite comedy and romance, he repeats the day over and over again becoming an omniscient god, and I especially liked the message that the movie leaves, it makes me smile.  2. **Donnie darko**  It is a film that had a great impact on me because of the decision made by the protagonist, it made me cry inside.  3. **Montage 2013**  a good detective movie, redemption and above all revenge but with a touch less of action and more of the relationship of life, I put this in particular here because it is my mother's favorite, I will only say how bad it is it feels long  Pontypool 2008  If you are looking for a suspense movie where everything happens on the radio, this is excellent and >!especially that ending so strange and funny at the same time I loved it!<.  **The Butterfly Effect**  classic and the firecracker scene hit me hard, that still hits me to this day in my mind before I go to sleep.  **kiseijû part 1**  Another great live action that I highly recommend if you feel like all live action sucks, this is a great option to see that you can do very good things that don't focus on comedy.  **Signs**  It is already a classic that everyone should know, quite dramatic and with great scenes that stay in the memory, but I feel that something is missing.  **A day**  the day repeats itself and he must save his daughter, quite dramatic but I feel that the plot in the end fell short and lacked polishing.  **museum**  Good movie about a detective and a serial killer.  **The Happening  2008**  I don't have much to say, it's fine but I don't like the relationship of the main characters at all, I feel that it becomes somewhat uncomfortable.  **Valhalla rising**  The Voyage of a Viking is the one I enjoy the most of the Viking-style movies, it has almost no narrative and is especially focused on silence and long walks and deep gazes, in a very barbaric style.  **Black death**  If you prefer something more European medieval style and not so Viking, this is my recommendation. A witches and knights film with a dark but realistic tone, it is not for everyone.  **delicatessen**  The weirdest movie I've ever seen but without losing its charm, I recommend it. It doesn't sound like a song made into a movie.  **When Nietzsche Wept**  You are looking for philosophy, this is my personal recommendation, I haven't seen many on philosophy, really, or rather I didn't find a good one, it doesn't satisfy my desire for philosophy, but it's passable and entertaining, the only bad thing is that it has very strange scenes which can be uncomfortable to watch with a lot of people.  **20th century boys part 2**  great villain, very good villain, I adore the scenes of this villain, that's all I can say about this movie, the rest is passable but the villain is the best of this movie and also of the manga honestly.  **9 2009**  This rather dark animated film marked my childhood, hidden among the children's films, this film clearly for adults with a lot to say about life.  **Poultrygeist**  If you want a movie that is the king of disgust, this is a classic that goes from looking for the record to the most disgusting of the cinema, and it succeeds, but that does not mean that it stops being entertaining and hilarious.  &#x200B;  **-honorific mention -**  &#x200B;  **Night of the creeps**  I didn't like the movie at all but what a great ending, it made me want to know what was there, what it was, I never imagined that I wanted a continuation of a movie that I didn't like hahaha."

        "body": "​Very few things I've watched over the years have had enough of an impact that I can say they “changed me” but Candyman from 1992 is one of those movies. Yes, it absolutely scared the hell out of me but it also made me a lifelong fan of all things horror. Books, movies, comics, if it leans horror I'm in, let's do it. If you watched the horror films I've consumed back to back it would take you literally years to finish the binge, it's that serious of a problem. Maybe it's more of a condition.  I was young, eight years old, when I first watched Candyman and the effects were almost instant, I say almost because for nearly a week I couldn't go to the bathroom if I was the only one awake. I couldn't walk past the bathroom mirror to get to the toilet if I didn't know there was someone who could potentially rescue me, or at least distract the monster while I got away. I was an only child so I was a bit selfish. You have to remember though, at this point in my life the scariest movie I had come in contact with was probably, Who Framed Roger Rabbit, and let's face it, that movie was also scary as hell.  I didn't get to see Candyman when it first came out—I grew up in a small town and the nearest theater was a couple of hours away—but we did have a Blockbuster Video, and we did, just about every weekend, take advantage of the (five movies, five nights, five dollars) deal that they offered. Going to the video store to pick out movies was a huge part of my childhood, some of my favorite memories are tied to that place. I learned a lot about myself by finding things I loved, and even things I absolutely hated, at a very young age. I've talked a lot about art before, art can teach you a lot about yourself if you're willing to listen.  So why did Candyman scare the hell out of me and how did that make me fall in love with horror? Well, one thing at a time. It scared the hell out of me for the obvious reasons, Tony Todd was a monster straight out my nightmares. The grimy coat, the meat hook constantly dripping blood, even his damn voice. If I hear that voice to this day I'll shudder. It probably didn't hurt that the summer before I watched Candyman I found out I was allergic to bees when I got stung on my eyelid and had to be rushed to the hospital. Then there was Virginia Madsen just selling the hell out of every scene she was in. When she was confident I felt confident. When she was scared I was terrified. She did an amazing job.  Bernard Rose wrote and directed the movie, it was top tier in my opinion from front to back. Of course it wasn't until years later when I was older and deep into my horror obsession that I found out all of this is Clive Barker's fault, the movie is based on his short story called, The Forbidden, an excellent read on its own. Candyman only went on to make about $25.8 million in the US on a budget of $30 million, but international and video sales kept it from being a bust.  For the second part of the question, how did it make me fall in love with horror, well, I didn't know movies could make me feel things like that so strongly. I was scared to death even though I knew it wasn't real, it made me believe those things were actually happening. It made me anxious. It made me generally worried for the people Tony Todd was after. I love all film genres but others fail to make me react with as many emotions as horror in such a short period of time. I think it's chasing that high, horror for me is like riding a roller coaster, you know it's safe (or hope it is) but you do it anyway for that adrenaline rush. I fell in love with the genre for that reason, I can get that feeling without ever having to leave my house and be around other humans, it's a beautiful thing.  By now I think I've made it pretty clear how I feel about horror and in my opinion there still hasn't been a movie to live up to Candyman (1992). It's pure terror wrapped in a neat 99 minute package that makes you feel all the feels. A perfect film and the perfect place to start for anyone who wants to have a reason to not look in the mirror for a while, as if I needed another.  Twitter/Instagram | CrockettForReal"

        "body": "The Shining is one of my favorite films - I've probably seen it 20+ times, and I've watched Room 237 at least 5 times.  I recently watched (and relatively enjoyed) Doctor Sleep.  That kind of sent me down a rabbit hole - I've known all the lore around the tension and differences between the Stephen King book and the Stanley Kubrick movie, but have never read the book myself.  So I read it, and then immediately read Doctor Sleep as well.    A quick summation of my thoughts on both the films and books:   The Shining is a great book, faulty book to film adaptation, and a Masterpiece film.   Doctor Sleep is a really great book, largely faithful book to film adaptation, good movie, AND a successful sequel to the 1980 film.    That last part I think is the most interesting - given the distinction between the King book and the  Kubrick movie, I think the greatest feat of Doctor Sleep as a film that it seems to function well as a sequel to both without very many issues, IMO.    TL; DR: The Shining/Doctor Sleep films and books provide a fascinating study of the process of book to film adaptation.    Curious to hear others thoughts, as well as likes/dislikes within the books and films."

        "body": "Despite its underperformance at the box office (in large part due to the poor timing of release & lack of adequate advertising by the studio, and controversies surrounding one of it's leads), Spielberg's West Side Story is one of the best films I've seen in years and I feel that it surpasses the 1961 version in every way. While you could argue that it did receive an adequate amount of attention as it received numerous awards and nominations, it appears to me that the majority of the movie-going public has not yet seen the film.  With this reimagining, I feel Spielberg brings his magic touch of telling a story on a massive scale while also making it deeply personal. Not only is the story presented in a way that is moving and endearing, but it's cast is incredible and the cinematography and lighting are phenomenal. Spielberg's version of circa 1957-58 New York City is almost magical in the sense that it's the New York that may have never actually existed but one that exists in our collective cultural mindset. Additionally, I have a great appreciation for the modifications made to this film from its source material, whether the order and context of songs having been reorganized, the dance and fight choreography feeling more 'real,' the casting of actual Latin American and Hispanic actors, and the expansion of and flushing out of certain characters, such as Anybody's (also enjoyed the changing of Doc to Valentina as not only a way to include Rita Moreno but also as a way to create a new character and explore new themes). While I think West Side Story is a pretty timeless story that holds up well no matter how it's presented, their's something special about this film - I'm not a massive musical theater or movie- musical fan by any means, but something about this one just really stuck with me!  What are your thoughts? Do you think West Side Story didn't get the credit it deserved? Do you think it will become more popular or culturally significant with time? I've never created a conversation/open dialogue thread on Reddit like this so I'm really interested to hear what people have to say!"

They came out in the early 2000s but they hold up against a much improved (production value wise) action industry of the modern day.   Besides their excellent use of shakey cam (which apon rewatch felt a little overexaggerated perhaps with my perception affected by its later overuse) and genral trend setting, the pacing is well done its unbelievable. Never am i bored, between car chases, peak fight choreography, and intriguing dialog.  However, the thing that really stood out to me most on rewatch was the sound design. The sound track is exceptional. But the moments without any music are probably the best. The fights feel so crunchy from the sounds. And the guns feel so... i cant find the word. The sound plays a huge factor in how these hold up.  What do you think? Product of their time or timeless action classics?"

        "body": "As many people continue to use and rely on Rotten Tomatoes to get a sense of how good a movie is and to often decide whether a movie is worth seeing or not, I think it's important to remind people that the Rotten Tomato score is not calculated as probably most people assume it is. Let's get into it:  Most people perceive it as a movie that has a 99% rating on RT means that the movie is reviewed as outstanding with a score of 9.9 on 10 or 99 on 100 for example. But it actually doesn't mean this at all.   Likewise, people often assume as RT critic rating of 50% as being on fairly poorly rated movie with a score of 5 on 10 or 50 on 100, whereas again, this is completely inaccurate.   I score of 99% means that 99% of the reviews were positive reviews. The reviews all could all have said things along the line of “a fairly good movie..” and it would be treated as a positive review. This doesn't discriminate between a review saying that the movie was fairly good and a review saying that it was the best movie of the century. Both are treated as just a positive review. So a 99% rating on RT in no way means the movie was outstanding. In fact, 99% of the reviewers could have given it a score of 7/10 and it the RT rating would be 99%.   The same applies for a movie with a 50% rating. 50% of the reviewers might have said that the movie is the best piece of work of all time, and 50% of the reviewers saying it was a fairly poor movie. If 50% of reviewers gave the movie a 10 on 10 score and the other 50% gave the the movie a 5 on 10 score, then the average scoring would be 7.5 on 10 and actually better than the movie that had a 99% on RT."

And I want to clarify that these aren't bad guys that happen to be English or portrayed by English actors. Our heroes are fighting the British Empire itself, and the baddies are an extension of that.  Similarly, American movies that take place in different time periods face similar foes. Revolutionary War movies also face off against the British Empire. WWII movies face off against Nazis. Cold War era movies face off against Russians/Soviets.  But what are some movies where Americans are the bad guys?  Edit: Lot of comments mentioning films that feature American protagonists who do morally questionable things. I was more asking about films where some other nationality are the heroes and the Americans are the bad guy, antagonist, stock characters.  "

        "body": "Here me out..  Presumably, the suit is the source of all Christmas magic, since it's the catalyst for creating and powering each Santahost. Upon the moment of their death, the suit consumes its current host entirely. Upon being put on by the next unsuspecting victim, the parasite permanently binds to the new host, takes them over, and endows them with the power of Santa. This enables and perpetuates Christmas and its associated magic. The suit does this without consideration for the host. Once put on, the host's fate is sealed.  The suit is so powerful that it creates and sustains every aspect of the Christmas magic we see. It's possible that the suit can even create life. Were the elves living the in North Pole before the very first Santa, or did the suit create them for its purposes? Flying reindeer, same thing. Did the suit force the elves to build Santa's workshop in the middle of a frozen tundra? It's possible that the entire North Pole is a manifestation of over a millennium of work by the suit.  Going further, without the suit, there is no Santa. And without Santa, there is no Christmas. However, in the brief period between consuming the deceased Santahost and Tim Allen putting the suit on, Christmas does not cease to exist. This means that the suit doesn't necessarily need a host to sustain it's magical power, it simply needs them to move. Therefore being the source of all Christmas magic, it's reasonable to believe that if the SantaSuit was ever successfully destroyed (if that's even possible) then Christmas would cease to exist.  And finally, every Santahost is doomed to the same fate - eventual total consumption by the suit upon their moment of death. Which poses serious spiritual considerations. When the dead Santahost is consumed, is their soul also consumed by the suit? Devoured? Spirited away?  And the suit has been doing this for over 1,200 years (Judy the elf's age). How many victims has the suit claimed? Is that how it sustains its power? Does it grow in strength with each meal?  And what is the suit's purpose? What does it want and where did it come from? Without answers, this is the only logical conclusion."

So many heroes have this hung ho badass attitude, cavalier aboht nailing the bad guy. Here Wills character just exudes the fact “He doesn't want to be here” you can feel adrenaline coursing through his body and that he doesn't s betraying every better instinct to go in. And you can feel him pushing through all of that because he has to retrieve the dog. Period.   We do not get enough heroes conveying that they are ANSOLUTELY terrified but have a thing they need to do regardless of all of that. To be that's the epitomy of heroism.  Ellen Ripley in ALIENS was another excellent example of this at the as she goes to retrieve Newt. I think Weaver even said to James Cameron during filming when they were picking out weapons she said “You know I hate gun.” And he replied “Thats exactly why you're perfect for this”"

Granted, Spielberg has enormous talent as a director but I honestly can't picture any of his great movies (Jaws, Close Encounters, Indiana Jones, Jurassic Park, E.T.) without hearing Williams' music in my head. Jaws in particular works so successfully due to it's music, the fact that this was Spielberg's breakout success just makes me wonder how the film would have landed without it's iconic score. And granted, Williams had already produced several soundtracks prior to working on Jaws, so maybe they just brought out the best in one another and it's truly hard to separate which component benefited more from their collaboration. Like Danny Elfman and Tim Burton or in the sports world Joe Montana and Jerry Rice. Just thought it was an interesting conversation worth having."

It is Peter's brother, who is living in Paris, that is paying for the McCalilister family to fly out there.  Kevin's Mom explains it to Harry (dressed as a cop), in the opening scene.  > My husband's brother transferred to Paris last summer and both of his kids are still going to school here, and I guess he missed the whole family.  He's giving us all this trip to Paris for the holidays, so we can be together.   Now, in Home Alone 2, it does appear that Kevin's parents are the ones who pay for the family to fly down to Florida.  Uncle Frank mentions it when scolding Kevin:     > Don't wreck my trip.  Your dad's paying good money for it.

I mean it literally begins with him walking why not end it with that as well?"

Anyone could have jumped in but they all just stood there staring at her saying “no it's too late.”) why all the lengthy heartfelt confessions and melodrama in the middle of all this intense zombie shit that they need to get in and get out under a tight timeframe.   So many plot holes and issues but imo the biggest one: why didn't the owner of the company give the group the combination to the vault? Like, it's his company, his vault with $200 million…does he not know the combination? Why all this nonsense with cracking a vault?   Also a giant explosion when a small car crashes into a military convoy.   Christ this movie was a mess and a total waste of time. Just lazy."

He wakes up, saves a bunch of people from this, and death comes for them in gruesome ways. They realise if deaths order is cheated or there's a death in the place of someone's, then it skips you. So by the end of the movie they think they're safe. Until they board a flight to france. First time seeing this my jaw absolutely dropped. They see Alex from FD1, freaking out, people getting off. Think nothing of it. Until the plane takes off. He puts his headphones on and hears the same same song from the start of the movie. Cuts his thumb like the start of the movie. Someone asks the flight attendant what happened.   “Kid had a panic attack and said he wanted off the plane, said he had some kind of vision”   Plane explodes. Full loop."

I've seen their work and they do bring something to the table imo. But Chris Pratt just makes me think generic white man energy so much, and I legitimately don't know what I am failing to get that everyone else is getting. Even weirder is that I actually watched and liked Passengers, I thought it was a cool plot with an interesting premise, but mostly just that the writing failed to live up to the expectation so the execution was off.

Indeed, I am not sure I have ever really read it, it may have just been an abridged version for kids.  Either way, though, does this movie not omit a ton from the book? Does it not alter its message?  For example. I believe there was a scene of Pinocchio being hanged. I don't recall it being featured in the film.  The book's message was a warning to young kids that they must not disobey their elders. In this movie, Pinocchio never does anything wrong. The only time he disobeys his Papa is when he goes with Il Conte Volpe, but he does not do that out of malice of ill will. How is that consistent with the tone of the book, which was a warning not to misbehave?

Okay, so can someone just explain the last 30mins of the movie? Particularly after the bombs go off as Katniss and Gale were heading to Capitol (the bombs that killed Prim) Everything sort of confuses me from there.  Particularly: - So, Coin also had her own evil agenda, right? And what was it? And how come after the bombs, everything went against Snow?( I know he mentioned it [the whole Coin set the bombs and it was filmed], but hasnt he done worse things and still retained power? Except for the rebels of course) - So, Gale knew about the bombs all along?, Was Gale aware of Coin's plan all this while? What if the bomb killed both of them? - Why was Katniss allowed to go home? - Do the games continue after this? Or did peace eventually start to reign? - ^^ Did the rebellion stop? Do the districts now live in harmony? Or there is no peace in Ba Sing Se?  I just honestly thought since Snow was the bad guy, killing him and taking down the Capitol will result in the end of the games and finally peace in all the districts"

Goldeneye is fantastic to me mostly because of its excellent pacing.  The slower parts aren't super long or drawn out, they're actually interesting and not overly sefl-indulgent (like the newer Craig movies).  The plotline is interesting but also simple enough to follow, and the cast isn't explaining the story to us.  Basically, it FEELS like a bond movie.  Its over the top, pithy, witty, has great car chases and shooting scenes, captures and escapes, huge explosions and tons of close calls.  Its kinda goofy like the older ones, but also pretty edgy and gritty.  To me its the perfect Bond movie.  To give context, my next favourites include Skyfall, The Man with the Golden Gun and TWINE....oh and I also enjoyed both Timothy Dalton Bond movies, and I wish he'd made 1 or 2 more.  He was the first 'gritty' Bond.  least favourite/ worst Bond is also a Brosnan (Die another Day)  there's some bad aspects in old Connery / Moore movies but at least they weren't try-hards like with DaD...  &#x200B;  Actually someone else suggested this, whats you're favourite bond movie per each actor?"

However, a number of horror movies seem to fit this mold, including The Cabin in the Woods (pure comedy into horror-comedy) or The Evil Dead II.  Any other movies that masterfully handle what should be a jarring transition? In the realm of horror movies, are there any examples of romantic comedies that turn into horror? I was struck by what Jordan Peele said about how comedy and horror often hit the same sort of beats and hinge on successfully flipping expectations in order to be effectively funny/scary, which is why they blend so well together."

Let's be honest, this isn't a controversial opinion or a hard case to make and probably has little pushback but I think the first Pixar movie still hasn't been topped in all these years by any studio.   The animation for its time was groundbreaking and seeing it around release was an unforgettable experience. I had seen The Lion King the previous year and that looked ancient in comparison. But that isn't the reason why Toy Story is the greatest animated movie of all time.   The story, memorable characters (Rex with his inferiority complex and non-confrontational nature, Buzz's Space Ranger obliviousness, Woody's jealousy at a new toy possibly replacing him and acting out, Mr. Potato Head's surliness, Slinky's loyalty etc.), emotional resonance, voice cast, animation, music, humor that appeals to all ages and the timeless nature of it. Some of the most memorable dialogue and one of the best buddy duos on screen ever. Other movies have many of these qualities as well, but Toy Story does it the best, in my opinion.  Every second literally counts (81 minutes) and there is no wasted motion. It is fast, explosive, perfectly written, funny, tense, full of character and takes a lot of risks with the premise and focusing on non-human characters and delivers on everything it promises.  The sequels were excellent (especially 2 and 3) but I don't think you can enjoy them as much unless you've seen the first because it depends on those original characters being established.

Just for the discussion, let's call the Omega the universe in which the Evelyn from the prelude (everything before the Part I - Everything title) lives.     So, what I get is that the Omega timeline is the one in which the fanny pack fight happens, in which Bagel Deirdre (verse jumped into Omega Deirdre) leaps at the staircase, and where Omega Waymond gets stabbed with the glass shard by Evelyn.     Also, I understand that Omega Evelyn is the Evelyn version that is the only Evelyn mind we follow in the movie (always verse jumped into each universe's Evelyn) - except, perhaps, during the flashbacks - it is blind singer Evelyn's mind who was into blind singer Evelyn's body when she pierced her own eyes.      I also get that the reconciliation scene between Evelyn and Joy near the end of Everything is not happening in the Omega universe. It is happening in one of the new year party universes.     But whose minds are the ones of Evelyn and Joy in that scene? I guess they are Omega Evelyn (who was the one Evelyn who evolved to become universally aware like Jobu Tupaku), and Alpha Joy (aka Jobu). Because that scene serves as the step for Jobu's spiritual pacification which led to her extending her hand out of the bagel or, in other words, reaching out to be saved.     But if that's the case, they are not mother and daughter, right?     On the other hand, when they verse jump they get the memories, experiences, skills and emotions from their versions they accessed. So it could be seen as if they are not only accessing their other selves, but that they are melding with them (well, what are our minds if not the set of our memories, experiences, skills and emotions?). So, in light of that, can we conclude that it doesn't matter if it was Alpha Evelyn or Omega Evelyn the one at the end, they were all one?     And the final scene at the non-destroyed IRS building... I understand that it is a universe other than Omega, right? And we are looking at Alpha Joy and Omega Evelyn at the end too, right?"

Yet I can't help but think of who could bring this to life: The animators of Sony have already proven they can bring comics to life with Into the Spiderverse and it'd be interesting to see them tackle something with such heavy subject matter, they'd be my first pick to animate I'd go as far to say that they're the ONLY team that could do it justice. As much as Steven Spielberg would be the obvious choice of director I wouldn't mind David Fincher taking a whip at it and to top it having the author (Art Spielgman) be the consultant for it all.   Anyway it was just a random though, what film adaptions would you like to see with your personal dream team?"

        "body": "**BACKGROUND AND INITIAL THOUGHTS**  I just rented Clerks 3 on YouTube and I am glad I did. I have been a long time fan of Kevin Smith, more recently more of an apologist of his latter work. I can recognize his films of the last decade have been controversial and more miss than hit. Though I don't let that detract from the great work the man has brought to us. He seems to be in a phase where he is more self serving with fanfare and inside jokes than producing empathetic and relatable storytelling he was known for.  All that being said, I have been excited for the prospect of a Clerks 3 for YEARS (honestly after the credits rolled on the second). I know Smith has rewrote it many times, with original actors signing on and then back off, putting it in a limbo. So I was definitely glad when he finally said Clerks 3 was written and about to officially begin Pre-Production. Time has passed and we were given our first trailer and I was a bit more hesitant on the quality, seems to reflect more of his current work than his past, but I love the series and was still excited to give it a go.  **REVIEW**  I am now in a post-Clerks 3 work and I can happily say the ride has been worth it. You can tell Smith wanted to covey the maturity he has gone through, especially after his heart attack, and portray that accurately with his characters. The acting with every one is a bit meh, especially Randal's performance, but I was able to overlook it. It kinda felt like a low production play which I think provided much of its charm in the long run. Spoiler here - >!I wasn't a big fan of what they did with Rosario Dawson's character in the beginning. But I think it paid off in the end. I just wish they could've done something a bit different with her character.!<  I laughed a lot. I cried a bit. Then I laughed some more. It is a beautiful full circle film that closes the Clerks storyline in a appropriate and succinct manner. Spoiler here - >!when Randal shows Dante the first cut of the movie. And it jumps to the movie theater where Dante is watching Clerks 1. I was blubbering like a baby. You could feel this is coming straight from Kevin Smith in his vulnerable moments during his own heart attack. !<  I would rate each film as such: Clerks 1 - 9/10. Clerks 2 - 8/10. Clerks 3 - 7/10. Clerks 3 is weakest of the trilogy, but it also has some great strengths, particularly during the final act of the movie.  **CONCLUSION**  I would highly recommend the movie to the fans of Clerks, it's a must. To classic Smith fans, it's also a must. Tons of cameos and callbacks to other films in the universe. For average movie goers, it depends on your affinity to the series and director as of late. You might find more misses than hits, but I think most people can agree it was a decent send off."

I watched some making of... videos on youtube about famous animated movies and it seemed that the roles are not so defined as in live action movies, the creative process involves the whole crew and it's so cool!

I really can't stand the dialogue from the duo of Stephen McFeely and Christopher Markus in particular. Especially because it really ruins what are otherwise awesome movies.  I also just watched The Gray Man and couldn't help but think how the dialogue completely sank what could have been a pretty solid movie.  If you think of a writer with a similar style to Tarantino, Crowe, or the Coens, please comment a few of their movies too!  Edit:  even though he only has a few movies under his belt, I think a hidden gem is Ben Affleck. I really liked the dialogue in Goodwill Hunting, Gone Baby Gone, and The Town.  Edit#2: I'm adding David O. Russell.  Absolute god tier dialogue."

Gripping and brisk first two acts, and suddenly a third act that makes everything that much better.  So with these movies as an example in mind, what's a movie that has an exceptional first and second act, only for the third to wrap it up perfectly making it an amazing viewing experience?  Edit: Thanks for the replies! I have seen Mulholland Drive, Fight Club, BTTF, The Prestige, and all of the Cornetto Trilogy (Shaun, Hot Fuzz, Worlds End) and agree that these are welcome inclusions."

Social commentary on rural life, racism and misogyny that isn't forced and comes in a very natural way.  Subtile details that are shown rather than told.  Gorgeous cinematography.   Action, yes, it has gun fights, it's actually wild.   Heartwarming moments that made me cry a river.

Eight Crazy Nights, on the other hand, focused too much on tugging on the heartstrings whenever it tried to do so that, when a fart joke or whatever suddenly popped up, it felt out of place.

Neeson can't do this forever; who's the next solid, liked, sort of thrillery actor who should pivot to making entertaining schlock? Or is that era coming to an end?  The actor shouldn't be much older than 50; there's only so much that can be done when an actor surpasses sixty. Russell Crowe is now too old, I think.  I nominate Aaron Paul; has the likeability, can use another win after minor roles here and there and the canceled West World. Still in his forties, but he's getting there - better start youngish."

But at least they somewhat look alike because the leading male roles are played by people who look nothing alike. Not a huge thing… I just feel this kind of movie almost needs that type of casting for it to flow and make sense. 2) I don't remember it being this cringey?! Maybe it's because I was younger the first time I watched it. Or maybe it's the acting? I can't tell. James Marsden is great and always is but, idk. I read the book and honestly loved the plot so not sure why it was cringey on screen.  That's it. Really I came here to say the eye color thing really annoyed me.

        "body": "Greetings! Recently I watched Miracle on 34th Street (1947) and it struck me how much my perspective has changed since I used to watch this movie as a kid. Two major aspects of this movie really stuck out to me while watching as an adult that I just totally accepted as normal as a kid.  First, Mr. Gailey as a protagonist... I used to really like this character and just assumed that he was a 100% good person that just wanted to spread love and joy and all the other intangibles. However, I see him now as kind of slimey. The fact that he openly admits to being nice to Susan to try and pursue a relationship with Mrs. Walker is kind of off-putting (not to mention he takes Susan to the Zoo without Ms. Walker even knowing about it, but the house maid so knew so I guess it's ok), but what really annoys me is how Mr. Gailey takes Susan to see Santa after Mrs. Walker explicitly told him she doesn't want Susan to be influenced by ideas that she sees as fantasy. To me, it would be the equivalent of a parent raising their kids to be athiest, and then someone comes along and takes their kids to church without getting the consent of the parent first. Mr. Gailey basically walks into Susan and Doris' lives and tries to enforce his world view onto them.   The other aspect of the movie that doesn't sit right is when Kris Kringle hits Mr. Sawyer with the cane. As a kid, it felt good to see this prick, Sawyer, get his comeuppance, but as an adult, I realize Kris Kringle not only lost the argument by getting physical first but he also validated part of Saywers concern that he was apt to become violent. Granted, it was for a different reason, but ultimately Kris did become violent first and then the movie glosses over that while still expecting you to feel sympathy for Kringle. If Kringle had just went to Mr. Macy originally like he said he was going to do without getting violent he wouldn't even have ended up in Bellvue and there wouldn't have been a commitment hearing in the first place.   So yeah, I still love this movie, still makes me laugh and smile but I have to put myself back in my childhood state of mind and turn off my cynical critic side."

We go from super exciting to very dull to exciting again in the last 10 minutes   - characters are rather poorly written. Affleck goes from leader/calm/ super planner/ conservative to plan sabotaging/ willing to kill anyone the moment he sees all the cash. The “best pilot” succumbs to the pressure of flying an overloaded helicopter in a second. Isaac probably was the only somewhat consistent character that we know something about   - Things just fall in place. “I know a guy” and everyone is super trustworthy.

Even Streep got some flack for getting all the big roles meant for older women. I remember Angela Lansbury wanted the part of Judi Dench had in NOTES ON A SCANDAL but that was in a period where Dench was getting all the big parts for women in her age brackett which are few.   Debra Winger, gone, Susan Sarandon, gone, Jessica Lange (thank god for Ryan Murphy or else she'd be in limbo). I even think Sharon Stone is a much better actress now than in her youth but she's not getting the big roles she once did."

This week that movie was Seven Samurai and since I had never seen it (even though it's been on my list for a good while) I decided to go see it.  I thought that the movie was amazing. The first act perfectly set up the conflict and all the characters.  I found the second act continued the character progression very well which gave you the feeling that these people could be real but they were still all interesting and unique. I also thougt that the antagonist (the bandits) of the film where showed in a very good way helping us realise why the villagers are so afraid of them. It also gave us a view of the life of a farmer during this time period and explored the cast sytem that was in place i japan during this time period.  This was all finnished in what was possibly the best final act in any movie ever. The action set pieces were fantastic and every plot line was tied up beautifully. And then the final shot of the four graves was probably the best final shot ever but to film.  I am very happy I was abel to experience this movie for the first time in the cinema it was one of my best movie experiences ever."

        "body": "A 3 minute live-action horror film called Fiona, based on the character from Shrek, released on YouTube last month.  The film starts with a knight leading up to the top of the tower where Fiona stands. Thinking he's her true love, she tries to kiss him, but is interrupted when she notices the sun setting down. In an unsettling fashion, she begins to quickly transform into her ogre form. We get a quick glimpse of her face, and it's a much more deformed and horrifying appearance compared to the original film. Her voice becomes more masculine and frightening. When the knight attempts to flea, you can hear her cry KISS ME! YOU HAVE TO KISS ME! KISS ME MY SWEET PRINCE. It almost sounds like a cry for help. Suddenly the knight trips on a leftover corpse in the hall, and while pausing, he hears the same uncanny voice shout COME BACK!. He continues to pause, when suddenly the green monster begins to run toward his direction. Rather than getting up to run again, he accepts his fate, but is surprised to hear chewing sounds from her finishing off the leftover corpse. He slightly tilts, as if he is attempting to escape, but the ogre immediately notices. The film ends with her grunting toward the camera, and the credits begin to play with a slow cover of All-star playing in the background.  I personally don't really like the concept of turning children's media into horror films. I don't mind making things edgier, like the Samurai Jack revival, but making a full on horror film, to me, is the equivalent of a traumatizing porn parody. I know that makes me kind of sound like a puritan, but it's just my opinion. I'm not demanding a ban or anything on this type of content.  I also think the quality of most of these films have been absolute garbage. The Banana Splits Movie is just a cheap FNAF rip off with horrible acting (I really hate the title too because it implies that this isn't a parody, but rather the same universe as the original series). The Mean One, which is a Grinch parody film, also has garbage acting and just a frustratingly bad script. And while it hasn't been released yet, Winnie The Pooh: Blood & Honey also looks very cheap and has a story that doesn't sound very fleshed out at all. I'm sure the upcoming Bambi won't be anything special either.  Before I saw this Fiona film, I thought the trend of horror adaptations based on children's media was just going to become the next generation of bad creepypastas. It's kind of funny looking back on those now, and the campiness of how scared everyone was of them during a time when it was new, and the internet couldn't easily contact creators of shows/movies to debunk this nonsense like they can now. Now we have a couple of REAL horror films and... in my opinion, they're not scary or interesting.  Fiona however is absolutely the best one in my opinion. For starters, unlike the previous horror movies that try to create new generic stories, this film is based off of an actual fan theory involving the character. Before this film released, people speculated that the knights in the original Shrek movie were actually remains that Fiona ate. Think about it. She was locked up in the tower, probably doesn't have access to food, and she's probably traumatized and struggling to balance her new ogre-self, and her human self. Think of it kind of like The Hulk (ironic I know. Green people). Ogres also traditionally eat humans in fairy tales. People have speculated that this is the real reason why Fiona's father locked her in the tower. To protect her from other people. The dragon was just a warning to prevent people from entering. As for The Fairy Godmother (who worked with her father) and Prince Charming, many people believe that the Godmother is secretly the witch who casted the spell on Fiona or was at least involved with that situation (she literally owns a factory where she invents magic and potions), and she ensured that Charming would have been immune to Fiona's actions. Shrek didn't eat humans because he just wanted to be left alone. He was BORN an ogre so he likely found an alternative for eating, such as cooking swamp animals, and didn't commit to any violent tendencies toward actual people. But to Fiona, it's just an affliction that takes over her every night. She can't control it. Shrek, a FULL-ON, probably helped her control it when he came into her life.  I know to some of y'all this sounds dumb, but people have fun writing these theories.  This short film is such a twisted and neat display of that idea. The people who made this were clearly fans of the source material if they were willing to create a movie based on this. The creators consider this movie, based on Shrek lore. I felt so bad for Fiona because she's clearly desperate to be normal again and would kiss any man who steps near her just to go back to having a normal non-isolated where she can no longer hurt others. Again, this is not my thing personally, but I can see why to some, it's cool to see a horror adaptation of this idea. The only problem I have with this film is that it doesn't make much sense as to why the knight doesn't fight back. He's literally carrying a sword, and risked his life getting there. And why doesn't he continue running after tripping? Why does he just decide well I guess I'll just die when Fiona's running after him? Kind of bad writing there, but otherwise, very interesting.  This could be the next generation of creepypasta. Having actual professional short movies based on fan theories. I wouldn't really want to see these as full feature length films because I feel like many of them wouldn't be able to manage for over an hour. But having shorts seem like a very satisfying concept for people who want to see these theories in a visual medium. Because of its length, these wouldn't have to be major big budgeted films either, but could still have passion and effort put into them."

Then the artists themselves  re-recorded their original tracks and ultimately, the actors ended up having to be reduced to lip syncing. Regardless if the actor approved of it or not, why not offer a different audio track on a Blu-ray or digital extra so a viewer could actually hear the actor doing the songs?? Why can't we, the audience, get to hear them and decide which we prefer?  I think it would be an awesome extra to have and see how well they did. I think films like the Buddy Holly story are the best in the genre for the very reason that the actor is singing the songs.   What say you?"

I have high respect for this movie, and I have so many good memories associated with it.  Bomb City (2017) was an indie film about my city, and was partially filmed in my city.  The premise, at it's core, is so simple.  Punks vs. Jocks, (No spoilers!)  I find it very personal due to the fact that I just left high school, was going to college for film, and was a very good movie made in my home town.  That and it was contrivercial as fuck when it came out.  No one talked about it, and no one really does.    Night of the Living Dead (1960) started my love for horror, and The Exorcist (1973) only expanded it.  But my real intro to a horror movie as a concept was The Texas Chainsaw Massacre (1973/2003.)  I went to an elementary school in the middle of a trailer park around the time the prequel to the 2003 film came out.  All the tougher redneck kids were talking about how awesome the movie was, trying to look cool.  I wanted to fit in, but admittedly, my parents were pretty sensible not to let me see it.  But then I saw it on YouTube when I was 13 or 14, back when people uploaded whole movies to YouTube in parts.  But funny enough, people thought it was lame by the time I had saw it.    Titanic (1997) was my first kind of mature movie.  Like, it felt grown up to see this movie, but as I grew up, I fell out of love with James Cameron's film, and fell into love with the 1958 film, A Night to Remember.  Honestly, I love both of them equally, but props to Titanic for sparking my interest.  Anyway, that's enough from me, what are some personal favorites for you and why?"

How would Commodus talking to her son reveal anything about the plan and make Commodus suspicious? He wouldn't even know anything about the plan, being a child and all.   Finding out about the escape just felt really forced. Still enjoy the movie a lot though, just was wondering if anyone else had any input on this moment in the film.  Edit: this article on medium.com explains the point better than I do.   “Commodus has discovered his sister Lucilla's secret feelings about Maximus, as well as her desire to oust him from his imperial position in order to reestablish Rome as a republic. As such, he is now indirectly threatening her son Lucius — thus terrifying her into spilling the beans about the plan underway against him — so he can squash these plans and ensure total command over his empire.  But do you also remember how he happened to find this out, mere minutes before the scene? Um… Lucius told him, by shouting out for all the world to hear that he wanted to be “Maximus, The Savior of Rome!” To which Commodus then naturally queried “Who said that?”  The scene cuts next to Lucilla entering the palace after her plotting, before coming upon her terribly vexed brother, who's now menacing both her and her child. This practically screams that it was Lucius's own mother who told him Maximus was here to save Rome. To which, when I watched the scene this last time, I responded with an actual, audible “WHY?! Why would she do that?!”  Because what do we know about Lucilla by this point in the story? We know from her father that she's wise; we know from Maximus that she has a “talent for survival;” we know from her own mouth that she's been living in a “prison of fear” since her brother became emperor and has only visibly gone along with him to save her son, whose safety is obviously paramount to her.  So then why in blue perfect hell would she tell him Maximus was the “Savior of Rome?” Why would this protective mother endanger her own son like that? Why would this talented survivor confide a secret THIS HUGE in a child, especially one that's around the Emperor so frequently? Why would someone this wise now jeopardize the plan she had — up to this point — so cautiously crafted in such a careless, idiotic way for no reason at all?  Plainly put: She wouldn't. That scene makes no sense whatsoever, given the pre-existing reality of the movie.”  Edit: some of y'all really need to take the nostalgia goggles off and admit when something is flawed, which is ok because it's still a fantastic movie."

The script was 2 pages long and the rest padding. The movie was to ambitious for what it really was.   There can be so many interpretations while none of them being right at the same time. As a film it completely failed and doesnt deserve the praise it gets. This film feels its geared more for a nitch audience thats likes looking into things to a microscopic level so they can argue amongst themselves on how they're view on the movie is right and the others wrong. In a casual viewing sense this movie makes no sense and its shit. If you can skip the first 30 minutes and not miss anything them you failed somewhere."

        "body": "I first watched the 1998 version a long time ago as a kid and mostly forgot about it. I recently rewatched it again and now I can't stop.   First, let me start by saying this movie is full of romantic comedy tropes, has several large plot holes (would parents in London really send their 11-year olds alone to an 8-week summer camp in Maine?), and has some dialogue that is so cloying it makes my teeth hurt. Plus the entire premise of twin babies being permanently isolated from each other forever because of divorcing parents is cruel at best and downright criminal at worst.   But despite all that, this movie is so adorable and wholesome that it's become a comforting experience that makes my heart so happy the entire runtime. If I've had a bad day, I can watch it to make me feel better. Heartbroken? Straight to it. It's a simple but endlessly rewatchable film for me.   Some of the things I love about this movie:  * Lindsay Lohan, full stop. She is an incredible child actress in this. The fact that an eleven year old can play two distinct characters, one of which has an accent, and then play the characters playing themselves again, is kind of mind boggling. A really good adult actor would have a hard time with that, and she pulls it off so wonderfully. She is adorable, has some incredible facial acting, and is completely the heart and soul of the movie.  * This movie has a lot of tropes but it also subverts them in good ways too. My favorite parts of the movie are when the girls' true identity is revealed to their parents/caretakers. There is no anger or frustration at all, simply amazement and joy at being reunited with what they thought they had lost forever, and that never fails to make me go all teary.  * The butler/nanny characters are not only some welcome comedic relief but do a good job of showing how they acted as the surrogate for the lost parent for each of the twins and made sure they grew up relatively normal. They are both also a big reason this film has such a big heart.  * The two parents played by Natasha Richardson (RIP 🙁) and Dennis Quaid actually have a lot of chemistry on screen, which is critical, but just as important is their parental chemistry with the two girls, which is also abundant and heartwarming.  * This is a Disney romantic comedy so of course there is going to be a happy ending, but it actually feels earned. The parents get back together but it's not a flip of the switch thing. In fact there are several false starts and it seems like they have failed only to succeed based on a shared mutual past and love of their children. As a parent myself, I find extra happiness in the ending, if nothing else for the sake of the girls.   This movie is not perfect by any means but it has a lot of soul and I just love it to death. If you've never seen it before, don't expect a masterpiece but give it a chance and I think you'll find it as cute and heartwarming as I do."

True Romance had that one scene where Patricia Arquette gets beat down by one of the baddies, and how it was shot to the acting, along with the music choice made it surreal.  Same goes for the ending to Man on Fire. Similar to how Gladiator used that Irish singer for conveying the feels, Man on Fire is equally as moving/sad.  Top Gun also is/was a monumental film judging by how Top Gun 2s opening is nearly identical, as a kind of homage to Tony. Tony went against Paramount execs decisions, went against the grain and we end up getting Top Gun, one of the most beautifully shot action and aerial film ever.

However, I think the movie actually made a better ending by fulfilling what Kate wanted all along. She had spent almost her entire life in hospitals, going through surgery after surgery. She knew the pressure it was putting on her family and on herself and she was tired of it. Her sister was created to be essentially spare parts and her brother was nonexistent in her mother's eyes. By letting go and forcing her family to do the same, she was giving them a chance at normality. Her parents would no longer be at odds with each other every time they forced Anna through another surgery and could focus their attention on the remaining kids.  The book's ending makes the meaning behind Anna's action pointless, she finally gains the freedom to choose just to fall back into being nothing more than parts. Her life ends with her becoming the only thing they intended her for. So personally i think the movie gave a more satisfying ending that felt right. Both sisters get to stand with their decision instead of their mother's. I would honestly love to hear others thoughts on this subject. Do you think the movie was wrong to change the result?"

        "body": "First off, nothing but spoilers ahead.   This is just a rant about Kingdom of Heaven, and how, over the years, I've strained so hard to like it. Even through the different versions and edits I have really tried to tell myself this is good film but what I always return to is the failure of the character Balian. (and Orlando. He did what he could with the script, but he's still a part of the problem in the end.) Kingdom of Heaven had infinite potential in its cast, a backdrop that was cinematic and epic with scenery, and a score that was sweeping. (minus the one musical cue stolen from The 13th Warrior which happens for no reason at the most pivotal moment in the film) -But it all came down like a house of cards because Balian is paper thin in personality and everything around him is gifted to him. Over the course of the film, Balian is; an expert blacksmith, a top tier swordsman, (despite what a 5 minute lesson might suggest) handed a knighthood as a Baron, given a ticket to the holy land on a boat which is destroyed at sea which only he survives, kills men who in theory should have been more skilled and experienced than he is, given an entire plot of land and people and loyal soldiers, thrown into the good graces of the king and his beautiful sister who both love him right away, given the command of an entire army and castle and even offered the damn throne. Now, I'm not saying this is what makes the character bad, but if you're going to give your protagonist absolutely everything, you need the balance of downs against those ups, and you need us to want to see him earn at least some of those ups. Balian not only doesn't earn those things, but he squanders them. I'll get to that in a second.  Next time you watch this film, play a little game where you listen to what Balian's friends and enemies say to him that are relevant and inspiring. Note how little Balian contributes to the dialogue and you see the second biggest problem; Everyone around this dude is cooler than he is. Observe as characters that are badass die-off while we're stuck instead with Balian, a man who sad-frowns his way through an epic that seems to push him forward like a toddler balancing on dad's shoes while he teaches him to walk. Why couldn't that German guy who fought with an arrow in his throat be the hero? We got like 2 seconds of him. Liam neeson was cool, he ran shit, but he's gone already. Imad ad-Din could have had his entire army come for Balian but instead he bows out of honor in losing a fight. Your quality will be known among your enemies, before ever you meet them, there's no comeback to that. Tiberius with his badass voice and no nonsense approach because he knows what's really going on. Sibylla is sultry and facing great emotional choices, Norton shines as a king without even showing his face, Saladin takes no shit, even Guy and Reynald hold the screen better. Then there's our hero. F*ckin' boring. Gifted everything. Nothing cool to do, nothing funny to say. Ohh does making everyone a knight make them a better fighter?! ..yes... Not badass at all. Doesn't even make sense.  Lastly, Balian is given a chance to save thousands of lives and kill one Guy, get the girl, and make a Kingdom of Heaven... but he doesn't do it because he has ..principles? and the movie ends in a confusing battle that doesn't even resolve and Balian ends up back where he started from. What a waste of time. Sure, it could be argued that this was the parallel of the crusades, but the message held no weight with this hero. Balian builds up his territory for his people and for what? To give it up when he had the chance to make a difference. The only good advice he gives in the entire film is to not chase Saladin into the desert, but this is already after he has given up the real chance to prevent it. Tiberius says there is no more Jerusalem speech and Balian just watches him leave and says one word, no. Still nothing worth saying so he fights a battle and goes on a film ending speech about how his men will fight to the death and he'll never surrender the city and concludes it by surrendering the city. I could go on and on but I'm tired of writing. I would love to hear if there's anyone out there with more opinions on this film. I'm not a professional critic. Am happy to read what you all thought of it."

Field also establishes (over and over again) that Lydia's perspective as a conductor is to sublimate herself and channel the intentions of the composer. Also dope. Also terrific.   Here's the sticky bit -- Mahler specifically asks for off-stage players in his other symphonies. #2 for example, has an entire off-stage band!  SO, is Lydia not as good at her job as she'd like us to believe? Is her philosophy of interpretation bullshit? I refuse to believe this was just 'overlooked'. But was it? Ack! Halp!"

        "body": "It has been said--and laughed at--before, but each year it becomes more true. Computers have enabled us to create almost any visual we want. We are limited by imagination and render time.  The problem, at least the way I see it, is that it's inherently unimpressive to take in.  It is not unimpressive *in principal.* Knowing the skill it took, the sheer number of people and the collective decades of work that went into it, those numbers impress. And the quality of their work impresses. But when you take those massively expensive, technologically groundbreaking visuals and make them into scenes in movies, they don't impress anymore. It becomes yet another kaleidoscopic color-scape that doesn't really mean much to me. When I want to see computer graphics pushed to their limits, I can get that in 3 minute doses on youtube. Mad Max's visuals are legendary, but if you remove them from the story context, they're arguably less interesting than Cyriak.  Why?  Story, of course. At this point you may be ready to bail because you're ready for this to turn into another they don't make 'em like they used to complain post. And I hope to prove you wrong. But yes, the answer is story--old or new, challenging or complex-- it's always story.  Story is the reason that we can be just as invested in Popsicle sticks and puppets as world-class CGI. People have cried (OK, *I* have cried) when Yoda dies in Return of the Jedi. And the quality of the workmanship by the Jim Henson creature shop impresses. And the puppetry by Frank Oz impresses. But if you put those same exact elements into a movie with a less comprehensible story (which may have happened, depending who you ask) then they no longer *impress* though they remain, factually, *impressive.*  So what am I supposed to think when people are telling me that I need to go see a movie for the visuals, when I'm already burnt out on the fireworks finale that is the average action scene? This, for me, is paradoxical. In a world where the limits on what a film can show have been obliterated, special effects *cannot* be the only thing that makes a movie worthwhile. It's like restaurants enticing customers by bragging about how indoor their plumbing is. It's a given at this point, and you only notice it when it goes wrong.  The most optimistic view is that people are so very invested in the story that it makes the visuals just that meaningful, and they mistakenly think that means the visuals are all that mattered. It's not uncommon for people to confuse story investment with being impressed by visuals.  But I'm not able to manage this optimism unfortunately, and I am forced to suspect that a movie which one must see for the visuals is one that I'm just not gonna get much out of. Because the visuals only matter if the story is good, and nobody is talking about the story."

I have never been a huge Disney fan, I'd rather watch a DreamWorks movie any time, but recently I've been checking new Disney movies to see what they've been feeding the new generation of kids. And I think it's fair to say, it's uninspired boring garbage.  The plots are extremelly predictable, the characters are one-dimensional and stereotypical, the dialogues are super cliché. Watching Strange Worlds in the theatre yesterday gave me a headache. The way these characters talked to each other reminded me of staged prank videos of 2010 youtube. The animation didn't look good, no matter how much money the spent on it, every character looked like another character from other animated movies. Lightyear also. It was the most boring, bland and sterilised movie I've ever watched. No remarkable struggle or conflict for a viewer to enjoy, only over-the-top cheesy emotional scenes with no value since we don't feel any connection to the shallow, poorly-written characters. Both these movies were supposed to be progressive and something we've never seen before but they managed to display more stereotypes and copy-paste character archetypes than any other dark disney movie of the past.   30 years ago, The Hunchback of Notre Damme managed to display both ethnic minority characters and a disabled person and humanise all of them, prove racism towards them is evil, make them all have a believable and inspiring arc and have a great story overall. What's more progressive than displaying gypsy and disabled characters as protagonists in a 90s movie? THAT was actually groundbreaking. I think the difference between Disney movies back then and the modern ones is that Disney used to animate already existing stories or at least existing concepts which all seem timeless and can be enjoyed by all ages at all eras. My parents used to love taking me to the theatre to watch animated movies with me because animated movies used to be family movies, not kids movies. I can't say the same for my future kids.   My suggestion for all animation studios that are still alive and still have a future (so many have closed down in the past 20 years...) is to give another chance to 2D animation and experiment with more mature plots. This polished, sterilised animation style has to go.  Maybe they should animate more classic stories and fairytales, with a modern twist of course to make them more relatable, and include more timeless and humanitarian concepts. Disney must understand that no amount of coloured or LGBT characters will make a boring movie interesting. No amount of dramatic action scenes can save a plot from being unattractive to wide audiences.  Thank you for coming to my TED talk. Would love to hear your opinions on."

I just watched it for the first time and already need to watch it again! So many questions! Is it all in his head? Did he really do the murders? Here are questions that I personally have kinda arguing why I personally think it might be mostly in his head:  If it was real, how come when he kills Paul, there's no blood anywhere besides him and the body? Could've been just director error, but the film was so well made otherwise, I don't see them skipping that detail..  If it was real, then how come no neighbors came out and called the police when the prostitute screamed and ran down the hall banging on doors? And, he was running naked and bloody with a chainsaw, and no one came out? He would've had to go back to the apartment and clean up and get dressed in order to go home, how come no one called the police?  If it's real, then the whole lawyer scene was just strange. Yeah, could've been him saying “hey man, shut up. Secret is safe with me.” But I draw back to the fact that earlier in the movie when he was talking to the detective (if he even existed) he said that Paul was gay and that it wouldn't surprise him if he was in London with a man or whatever. What if the lawyer was his lover? Why else would they both be in London?   If it's real, the landlord lady? That whole thing was weird too, like yeah maybe she covered the whole thing up, but she did kind of look frightened by seeing Patrick. Maybe she knew he would be the only one who knew about all of that? This one I'm still in the air about.   I could maybe see the homeless/random person killings being real, but I really don't know if all of them were. I think that a lot of them were him imagining them while listening to his walkman at work and drawing and kind of zoning out into a trance like state.

I'm going to first present my changes I'd make if I were one of the writers and then go over them after the bit. The goal is maximum satisfaction with minimal changes.  First and not part of the ending changes, ejection wings need to have been used or otherwise setup earlier in the movie. It could have just been a throw away line of dialogue when discussing the newest ships specs, that there wasn't a settup to that payoff was just sloppy writing.  Okay onto the main changes, we're keeping everything the same up until the fight on the bridge of Old Buzz/Zurg's ship (except for adding the wing settup).   Izzy and Sox see the fighting going on across the gulf of space, they start their jump and miss sooner into the action. The bump into the console that causes them to miss also destroys the console this is also where we get both Buzz and Old Buzz stunned. Under the bridge Izzy manages to grab hold but Sox does not and to save him she has to fully let go and leap into the void facing her greatest fear, but even though Sox is a robot she's not ready to let him go into the thing that scares her the most alone. But now she can't get back to the ship without help. So she radios Buzz.  Back on the bridge we get a perspective shot of one of the Buzz's opening their eyes when they hear a voice calling for Buzz to help, but what they see isn't Izzy it's Alisha her grandmother. They call out “I'm coming!” and that's when we realize it's old Buzz's voice. Old Buzz goes out the airlock in the Zurg suit and goes to rescue who he thinks Alisha but when he gets there the blurriness fades and he has a moment of anger/fear/not understanding “who are you? You're not Alsiha! “No, I'm Izzy Hawthorn her granddaughter, who are you? How do you know my Grandmother?” We get a shot of Old Buzz's face in the Zurg suit, a look of recollection crosses his face, flash back to him briefly seeing her after returning from one of his missions, of him seeing the hologram of her talking with her grandmother about him, he realizes the terrible things he's done and what he was about to undo, he brings her back to the ship.  Back on the bridge young Buzz greets them and then gets to tell Izzy how proud Alisha would have been of Izzy facing her fear and saving Sox. Old Buzz seeing this them collapses and the helmet mask thing comes off. Izzy is now faces with the realization that the man who was attacking them and doing those terrible things was also her grandmother's friend. Sox also is confronted with why there are two Buzz signals, and the remains of the old destroyed Sox. There's not too much time to ruminate on it though because the console being smashed means they can't stop the self destruct sequence or the rampaging robots. They're going to use the teleporter to get back to the ship but Old Buzz looks at the destroyed Sox guiltily not willing to go because of the guilty of what he's done. The current Sox puts his paw on him though and says “She wanted us to help you help yourself through your guilt”. And he goes with them.   They teleport and the ship still explodes before they have the fuel crystal loaded. Buzz gets the crystal and loads it into the ship but they still have too much inertia and some of the control surfaces were damaged so Buzz still does the thing with the wings to try and save the ship but it's not enough power. Old buzz goes out of the ship in his Zurg suit to help him, he takes the load and Buzz acts like a rudder or aileron. The rest of the team all still do their stuff but the landing's still rough and the Zurg suit is badly damaged. They get out to check on Old Buzz and it turns out his lower back was broken in the crash and he can't feel his legs.   The authorities arrive and Old Buzz agrees to do the time for the things he did/was going to do. He looks to young Buzz as he's being brought away, You know I did this all because I just wanted the chance to fly as a ranger again and now I never will. You'll have to fly enough for the both of us.   The crystal is used not to send everyone home, because now the population is too large on this planet to take the ship back. Instead they use it to send representatives to establish contact with the larger human civilization. Distant relatives of families that were separated when the science ship was first stranded are finally reunited. The misfit crew then get to become the Universal Protective Galactic Rangers or whatever. Young Buzz and crew get ready to launch back at mission control we see Burnsides watching as Old Buzz helps with the launch from control side with exosuit/robotic legs to help him walk and one of the wrist monitors Darby was wearing.  So, I think this fixes the issues that I found unsatisfying with the original ending. First the emotional catharsis didn't feel like it was there in the original ending, I think this brings more feelings to it. It addresses old Sox death, gives Izzy more of a moment confronting her fear, Old Buzz learns a karmic lesson and gets a chance to move on. Second, Disney is surprisingly blood thirsty when it comes to villains, without giving them the chance for redemption, and I think some examples of empathy/restorative justice are good examples to make. I don't think taking a life should be done as easily as it is in kids movies, even if they're a bad person. Third, this addresses an issue I had with them film that was really never addressed and that's what about the people where the Tulip came from? You know, their mission control, and their families, and the world they left behind. Yes, they started a new one on the new planet but still it's weird that they all just became okay with not letting Earth(?) know what happened to them. Finally, I know it's a kid's animated movie, but Buzz using the wingsuit to support and steady the ship broke my suspension of disbelief. I could more easily swallow it and suspend disbelief if the beefier Zurg suit was also pitching in to help. And I think that covers it."

I'm not a skilled writer but I wish someone would write a script of such an adaptation. What would such a movie look like? What are the pros and cons of a science fiction adaptation?

I also like how they had more heart than expected and they covered all these different stages of life and how the whole series actually has the theme of growing up. I liked the characters and actually felt sad at the end of the last one. Anyway, American Reunion is one of the better legacy sequels I feel. The high school reunion setting is the perfect setting, the movie stays true to the characters in the original films, and finishes out all their arcs. The writers/directors are Jon Hurwitz/Hayden Schlossberg who went on to make Cobra Kai. The way they treat Johnny in that show is similar to how they do Stifler here. Taking the same character and transporting him to a new time and let him remain the same despite how the world around him as changed. Honestly, if you want to make any legacy sequel, hire these guys"

This kinda stuff fascinates me.   I'm using del Toro's Pinocchio (2022) as an example as it's a masterpiece in its own right, including its voice acting - and across all the languages it features. To know what I mean, watch the “Everything is new to me” part in the film where Pinocchio sings (scene where he is first introduced) in multiple different languages and just compare them to one another. It's a demanding song for a young voice actor and Pinocchio's voice sounds IDENTICAL across different languages.   Disney classics and Pixar films have also been amazing in casting very similar sounding voices across languages. How do they do this? How is it possible these voice actors sound like the _same person_ speaking different languages? Are these just genuinely similar-sounding people or are modern films using some kind of voice-changing technique to make sure all voice acting sounds true to its original actor's voice?"

Then later i think he (Daniel Brühl) got hit by a explosion which kinda messed one side of his face, and he fell in love with the nurse or they were already dating not sure. That's all I remember.

Eo  I am happy that Guillermo del Toro actually did Pinocchio justice unlike the other movie that came out this year and I loved how he made it a stop motion. Watching that movie made me feel like being a kid again, and the movie was beautiful from how the characters look, the story and the scenery.  For those who haven't seen Eo, do yourself a favor and watch it, all I'm going say is it follows a donkey through good and bad times with owners. A true roller coaster of emotions.  What's everyone's opinion on there own Top 5 movies of 2022"

Putting this clarification as high up as possible because a lot of these early people responding seem to have only read the title and are dunking on me for thinking a movie is a documentary.]  Obviously, most historical fiction embellishes some stuff for an exciting narrative, but what I'm referring to is the ending where the assassination turns out to be a success. Even though we know in real life Hitler dies later on at his own hands, here Tarantino gives us the catharsis of watching him and the other Nazis get shot to death (and also burned alive) a bunch of times.   I've got this idea in my head of audiences watching the movie in 2009, filled with dread, because they know Hitler can't die yet so all our heroes are doomed to fail. It makes the fact that Hitler actually does die feel like such a cool, triumphant twist. But were audiences really as surprised by this as I like to think they were, or did they already sort of know going in to expect some historical revisionism? (I didn't watch it until years later.)"

The man is a national treasure and he deserves the chance to make people laugh, once again in all his interviews its quite clear that he just has fantastic comedic timing and wit.  Edit: People mentioning his classic comedies, yes guys thats what i'm talking about. But have a look at his imdb filmography. The best he had for comedy anywhere even in memory was the lady killers and that movie is damn near 20 years old. Somebody get a funny f*cking script into Toms hands please.

        "body": "So I LOVE going to the movie theater! Pre-pandemic I was going like every other weekend it felt like. I still love going; it's just hard to find time these days (and good movies!).  But anyways, that's a topic for a different day. Today I wanted to discuss a different, though somewhat unexpected issue when at the theater with your friends. It's kind of hard to explain so let me try to explain it through a simple story.  So my friends and I are all talking and having a genuine good time as we are walking into the theater. We use the bathroom, buy our popcorn, etc. and then walk into our specific auditorium. As we walk up the stairs, we find the right row for us to sit in, walk down the aisle to our reserved seats. Whatever order we happen to be in is the same order we are in when we sit down in our seats. Now here's the thing: if you happen to be at the front or end of the group, then you likely got an edge seat, where instead of having two neighbors, you have one.  Now, I don't know about you guys, but this can sorta blow, especially if you are not as close with the guy you happen to sit next to. This definitely doesn't ruin a movie or anything like that, but it can really bug me out a lot more than I think it should and I was wondering what other people had to say about it. I don't want to be that guy who asks to switch seats. That just feels rude. Idk, there just doesn't really seem to be any good solution to it other than to position yourself smartly in advance haha.  Edit: so a lot of people have been telling me that this really shouldn't matter and that the fact I'm talking to my neighbors is pretty bad and I should just watch the movie. In hindsight, I totally get that and will keep it in mind going forward. But at the same time, is it really that bad to whisper to each other like a few times and share a few giggles that no1 else outside my friends will hear?"

Scott gives an acting masterclass as Scrooge--the depth of nuance in his expressions and line readings is unparalleled. He really imbues the character with pathos, and you can see the transformation take place over the course of the spirit visits. The supporting cast is fantastic as well, especially David Warner as Bob Cratchit. It's really hard to believe this was a made-for-TV movie--Scott treats it like a Shakespeare production of the highest order. A true classic."

Whether action packed, sci-fi, horror, dramatic or otherwise, movies can reach art form to me when they are relatable and I find some personal connection with them. So fellow movie buffs, what ends to which movies hit you the hardest? No wrong answers of course, this is all subjective!  My list is as follows in no particular order. (Spoilers)  **1.** *Braveheart*\\- FREEEEEEDOM!   **2.** *Gladiator*\\-  Father to a murdered son, Husband to a murdered wife, And I will have my vengeance... in this life or the next. Along with an astounding soundtrack what more can I say.   **3.** *The Sixth Sense*\\- The twist ending was out of this world when I first saw it in theaters but was also heart wrenching when Bruce Willis's character makes peace with his death as well as saying his farewells to his sleeping wife.   **4.** *Terminator 2*\\- Saw this for the first time at a hotel back in 93. Easily one of my all time favorite movie memories. More impactful than sad but nonetheless Arnie melting himself to the T2 theme. Whew   **5.** *No Time to Die-* Daniel Craig's Bond has mastered his way through nearly every situation he's been in but when he's inches away from peace with his family, his luck runs out. Couldn't Q at least make him a bubble suit? Sigh.   **6.** *Titanic*\\- Jack is a cool cat who sweeps a helpless Rose off her feet from the overly controlling and mundane existence with her rich fiance and mother. From Jack and Rose's fight for survival as well as the 2,240 other passengers as Titanic sinks, this movie tugs at the heart.   **7.** *Forrest Gump-* A masterpiece full of loss, joy, love, humor, and perseverance from a young man who seems slower than others but is probably sharper than a needle point.     Feel free add the same movies I've added if they've impacted you or different movies that hit you harder. I'd love to see some lists of movies I haven't thought of or perhaps haven't even seen.   ## "

They ended up with such a great relationship that is so genuine and unforced, but you could also see the pain that RDJ still deals with when they discussed his early years and the regret from Senior was palpable in those moments as well.  That said, I don't feel like this was ever an unhappy film, it was bursting with life and creativity and the love of those things.  Thanks to the both of them for giving us a great film.

Portrayed as a gruff man of incredible power presiding over the largest battle in human history, a man who casually orders the suicide of battle-hardened high ranking generals when he sees fit.   However, when he picks up the phone and hears the voice of his boss, Joseph Stalin, he goes white as a sheet.  From television, but another example would the scene in Boardwalk Empire where Nucky Thompson meets with billionaire and treasury secretary Andrew Mellon.  Nucky, the main character, is not only a ruthless gangster but a wealthy legitimate businessman and a powerful political figure with all sorts of friends in high places and fingers in pies, the epitome of corruption and influence.   But when he goes to see possibly the most powerful financial figure in the country in a Diogenes club style retreat that looks like the kind of smoke-filled-room the Illuminati would hold meetings in, he looks as nervous and powerless as a little kid.

Second: The plead before arriving the plane on the Real World  The moment Jack says -We have a house in Jersey!- She looks back in surprise. Not in embarrassment, sadness nor anger. Surprise. Almost as if she had some knowledge of what happened on the Family Realm  So, perhaps the promise she made to Jack in the Family Realm actually allowed her to retain some glimpses of said Realm?

I got low expectations since I didn't watch the first movie and was disappointed with Shrek 4.. And boy, I was pleasantly surprised in the quality of the movie and was excited to the future ot Shrek's franchise!  As a huge fan of Spiderverse, I was so excited that it's style of animation was being felt in the movie. It's like the best blend of 3D animation and 2D drawings. There are scenes in the movie in which my eyes nearly pops out on the smoothness and stylistic choices of the animation (there isa scene that it looks like came from a comic book).. It should be seen to believed and I think it's the most accomplished animated film this year technically..  The story is simple but it asks difficult questions about mortality, the sense of being a family and someone's wish and version of happiness. I think IGN is right when they say it's like a Logan film.. The answers it asks may be difficult, but in the end it successfully wraps it up with a sense of accomplishment.. Kudos to the arc of the Goldilocks and Bears, it got me manly tears and Florence Pugh is really a star!  The highlight of the show is Perrito, the therapy dog. The film got so much laughs for his antics but underlying that is a sad story of a dog wishing for a family.. The themes of family is very pervasive of  and I'm so thankful that they handled it beautifully.   The voice cast is phenomenal. Antonio Banderas is Puss in Boots and his character arc with Kitty Softpaws is probably the best part of the film. Goldilocks and the Bear family is impressive and Samson Kayo as a baby bear is a standout! Salma Hayek gives her Kitty Softpaws character a sense of vulnerability and longingness that will delight you. The less said about Wagner Moura's The Wolf the better, you should hear him in screen to be really AFRAID..   Last but not the least, the humor is amazing. There are some references that will get heavy laughs tinged with sadness (Perrito, I love you!) .. The balance of humor with popular culture is top-notch.   Overall, this is one of my favorite films of the year and is leagues above the Disney/Pixar 2022 output. I really wish that it would win an Oscar since HTTYD didn't win any.. DreamWorks is in the roll and I'm excited for their future succes! I can't say enough good things about the movie!   5/5  Technically marvelous with outstanding voice cast, Puss in Boots asks difficult questions and answers them beautifully"

They can portray Lucifer as a kind of Loki character, where he tricks and deceives other angels to join his side. He manipulates them by saying how arrogant and narcissistic the Christ god is. And the angels would be like “yea, you know what? You're right, this is bullshit!”  Then at the end there is a massive battle between all the arch angels leading as generals of their legion of angels vs Lucifer and his army. At the end of the battle, Lucifer loses and god punishes him by sending him into the fire realm.   Then you see Lucifer and his army fall into Hell and you see them lose their angelic look and become more monstrous and demonic. But the Christ gods plan backfires because instead of being punished, you see Lucifer become the ruler of Hell, and at the end of the movie you see the newly named Satan plotting in hell for his next attack, with his legions or monstrous demons bowing to him.

        "body": "I just finished watching this movie and it really stayed with me however all the reading I've done online afterwards, no one has presented this explanation of the ending so I thought I'd make my case.  *SPOILERS*  I believe Paul sexually assaulted Frankie on one of the nights at the hotel. The night that Paul is stroking Frankie's hair and they're discussing whether she'll stay in Scotland her whole life. After they cut away from that, it cuts to the song Tender by Blur and adult Frankie is in the club watching her dad dance with the lights cutting in and out. I believe every time this scene comes up, it's adult Frankie having a PTSD flashback. In addition, the use of songs and song lyrics are so crucial in this movie which doesn't have much music otherwise. And the most telling thing for me was the way the scene ends, ominously zooming out on their hotel door. Something is clearly happening inside.   Lyrics to Tender by Blur  Tender is the night lying by your side Tender is the touch of someone that you love too much Tender is my heart, you know I'm screwing up my life Oh Lord, I need to find someone who can heal my mind  The next day Paul is hanging out on the ledge of the balcony and looks like he's thinking about jumping. Later on, Frankie is sitting by the pool and she initially doesn't want her dad to put the sunscreen on her back (doesn't want to be touched by him). Which is out of character for her. I believe she's likely tucked away the memory of the previous night but feels a subconscious response that she doesn't want to be touched by him.  Later on that night, Frankie sings REMs Losing My Religion. Which I think is very telling of how she's feeling at that time, that was just a dream. It explains why Frankie was so upset at her dad afterwards, because she just wants to remember things as they were before, but him not agreeing to sing with her is a stark realization that things are now divided. It was not a dream.   At the end of the movie, Paul and Frankie have one final dance to Queen's Under Pressure. I believe this event triggers Frankie's memory of the terrible event that happened a couple nights prior. You can tell she doesn't want to dance but her father forces her. And at one point, you can see Frankie crying in her father's arms, almost struggling to get away. As a result, adult Frankie is now dealing with PTSD and the club dance scenes are how she's compartmentalized that memory. In addition, the Queen song's lyrics This is our last dance, This is ourselves, Under pressure explain a motive as to why everything has happened.   It's clear Paul is struggling with depression and where he is at currently in life. He feels pressure to be someone who's made something of himself at 30. I believe the purchase of the Turkish rug was an example of how flawed his thinking is, thinking that this rug will change his life or improve his relationship with his daughter. I don't believe we ever see the rug again. I think Paul latches onto the only person in his life who gives him unconditional and undivided attention. As a result, he makes the terrible mistake of confusing the love he has for his daughter as romantic love. And of course, their relationship never recovers.  All this seemed very obvious to me after I finished watching however most other explanations I've seen never mention any abuse and focus more on whether Paul killed himself at the end. I really think that point is almost irrelevant to the underlying theme of the movie, a child struggling to deal with a jarring event that happened in her past as an adult.   Let me know what you all think! At the very least it was cathartic to write out my thoughts on this movie, even if no one else agrees.  Thanks!"

Although these countries produce wide variety of content I think we should also see a other countries' approach in movie making. The success of parasite in Oscar's makes me think maybe more people will appreciate non english films. Maybe it's just me but I wanna experience other cultures on the big screen  With that said what countries do you think will be more popular or should be more recognize in cinema?  1. I think indian films are cool. I've only seen some amir Khan's  films so I'm not entirely sure. Not a big fan of the singing  parts but its tolerable and as I was surfing youtube last night, I'm surprise to  know that indian music have inspired some american songs. I think indian films getting more popular will not only promote their culture and philosophies but also promote exchange of ideas in music as well.  2. South east Asian films. I'll mostly talk about philippines but I assume other sea countries are the same like us culturally. Philippines have heavy folklore, we have lots of gory monsters and spirits, I believe other south east Asian countries are too. Westerns movies are usually about personal growth while Japan's are about friendships and teamwork, we are just like japan but I think on a bit bigger scale. Were all about collectivism, it's like the whole community is one whole family. Right now our cinemas is mostly bad or a copycat of other cinemas but i  think it'll get better if we embrace our culture more. I hope to see more of our values, philosophies and folklore on our cinemas in the future.  3. Chinese movies. We all know how fun chinese action and kung fu movies can be. Comedies are great too not just the kungfu comedy but film like cj7 is also great. Honestly, I dont know a lot about Chinese films, I love Jackie chan and I've seen some of stephen chow's hits, but that's that. I wanna see more of these films. Maybe its just nostalgia because these films are fun to watch as a kid but really I wish seeing this movies and I wanna see more of them.  These are some of my ideas what else do u think?"

I can see he's heading into the socially awkward territory, and I like to give him some tools to deal with it."

However, rather than shitting on the movie, I want to see if anyone can answer some of these questions that leave me so frustrated.  - Why were all the cooks so obsessed with the main Chef? Why did they simply accept the idea of dying? It is told to us that he wasn't even the one who suggested the idea of everyone dying, it was simply another cook. I know the movie hints to the idea of it being a cult of some sort... But why? How? What's the context?  - Why does the Main Chef obsess with the protagonist girl 'Margot' beyond the fact she's also someone working in the service industry (as a prostitute). Why does he purposefully lie about them needing a barrel to make her fetch it? Why does his Right Hand of sorts shout You will not replace me!!! To Margot when she's trying to kill her? Wasn't she aware that they would all die in the end anyway? What does she mean with replace really? What was the purpose of creating such chaos in the first place for the main chef??  - Why is there an exact replica of the restaurant inside of the Chef's supposed Home where no one is allowed to enter? I assume that he was somehow planning it beforehand, but like... Huh? Does this mean everyone rehearsed it? In there? Why is it such a big reveal? Margot reacts in a way that expresses her surprise pretty openly to get the viewer's attention. The grey door seems to lead into a sort of special bedroom where it's hinted he even has (or had) a family. What's inside of the exact same door back in the main restaurant? It's clearly a big deal since Margot was told not to touch it when she was trying to find the bathroom.   - Why does everyone simply accept their murder? The clients, I mean. The Chef even remarks in an earlier scene that they could've easily escaped or somehow overcome their captors. But the peak of ridiculousness is them simply sitting down in place as they are dressed with chocolate and marshmallows just to watch the Chef walk in slowly and essentially murder them all.   - Was there anything deeper to Margot's date/client? Or was he literally just an insane individual? It is told to us that he was, for some reason, so accepting of his death that he went in knowing he'd die, just wanting to experience it all, even going as far as telling his girlfriend who breaks up with him. Could he really just commit suicide based on what the chef whispered? No matter how mean it was? And why *exactly* and how did he manage to have some personal contact with the main chef? He seems like a very deranged individual whose life revolves entirely around the restaurant.  - Margot was fearing for her life DEEPLY. And she found had empathy for the other clients, to the point where she openly tells them SHE called the coast guard to help them all escape. So why does she stop the boat and eat her burger like it's no big deal as she watches everyone burn to death? INCLUDING the innocent clients whose 'crimes' included going to a private college with no debt and acting in a bad movie. Is the answer really just Cause it's a dark comedy ????  These are some of the questions I can remember off the top of my head. I know this is supposed to also be a 'dark comedy' but I don't think it's an excuse for these things to be presented and have absolutely no explanation. The world SEEMS to be rooted in reality, so why do the characters behave so nonsensically??"

It is just much more suspense and scary. Im just not a fan of changing the genre after the first movie. It went from horror to action. I love horror and action movies, but it feels very off when the successor is suddenly changing their genre. You know what I mean?  Spiderman 1 Villain looked maybe a bit silly, but tbh he was very terryifing in the way how he acted and while the action didnt look as spectacular with all the special effects as in the second one it was much more grounded, brutal and punchy. Here again, the first Spiderman felt overall grittier than the second one, though I agree the hospital scene in 2 was scary and an exception.

Henry wants to give his kingdom to his son John for Christmas. Eleanor wants to give the same kingdom to their son Richard. Hilarity ensues as they try and bargain with each other to get what they want.  Discovering the importance of family: Check. Henry has some Christmas drama with his sons (including sentencing them to be executed) but ultimately realizes that family is the most important thing, and is unable to keep them imprisoned in the wine cellar.  A Christmas wedding: almost Check. Henry II arranges for Richard (his son) to marry Alais (his lover), despite her being betrothed to John (his other son). It all gets cancelled at the last second, however, when Richard discovers Henry is only doing it to get the Aquitaine.   Seasonal good cheer: In spades. How can you not feel good with a film that has such heartfelt dialogue as:  Eleanor: *My what a greedy little trinity you are: King, king, king! Two of you meet learn to live with disappointment*.  Henry: *Ah, but which two?*  Eleanor: *Let's deny them all and live forever.*  Henry: *Tusk to tusk through all eternity!*  Die Hard hasn't got anything on this film.

Who in their right mind would do something like that? 😡  Idiot plots are the worst kind of plots because not only do the characters look dumb, but it makes the audience think they're dumb as well for being forced to watch such idiocy. That's why I tend to avoid them and only watch them when I'm oblivious to the movie beforehand. 👍🏻  What about y'all? 👀  Note: I'm referring to movies where the characters were unintentionally written as dumb and not intentionally. Then again, some directors and writers hate the movies they're involved in so maybe they intentionally make the characters like that out of spite. It can go either way. 🤷🏻‍♂️"

However Mamma Mia: Here We Go Again is, while not a great movie, an improvement; there's still not much plot but at least the dual plots with Sophie and the younger version of Meryl Streep's character makes things more interesting as does its emotional core, the singing and choreography are much better, the editing is much smoother, and there's more color in that movie than orange."

This was the turn of the century. Live action/CGI movies seemed all the rage, but most were poorly done or poorly written. Stuart Little was different. When it came out in 1999, it was well written, well acted, and the animation was stellar. I dare say it is a classic today.  Come 2002, when Stuart Little 2 came out. Everyone from the first film came back. I'd argue the second film is better than the first. By that time, Pixar had released two Toy Storys and A Bug's Life, but the animation in Stuart Little 2 still manages to stand up today. It's just a fun movie, with jokes for kids and adults. Plenty of jokes I remember from the sequel but didn't get until I had the internet to explain them to me; a hallmark of early 00's kids movies/TV that practically begged parents to watch the shows with their kids. Parents were also much more likely to watch shows with their children back then, instead of just turning on the TV and forgetting about it, so movies and shows had to contain a blend of humor fitted to kids and adults.   Stuart Little and it's sequel contain plenty of those “adult” jokes. The humor is clever, but tame for kids. The animation is immersive and hasn't aged a day. The performances are surprisingly good (who would've thought Dr. House would make such a good WASP).   It's an iconic part of my childhood, and I'm glad to enjoy it still, even as the years have passed me by. If I don't like watching Stuart Little and it's sequel when I'm 50, then I hope I die at 49."

The audience sat in almost complete silence at the end of the movie, no applause whatsoever. Theater was maybe 75-80% full.  This is bound to be a really divisive film and it will no doubt be talked about in years to come. The marketing was brilliant in how it didn't reveal much. I think the movie could defy expectations and be a legit Box Office hit like Black Swan.  The movie is overwrought and melodramatic but there's never been anything like it, at least that I've seen, in the cinema. And, like Requiem, I never want to watch it again. Fraser was amazing.  TLDR Brendan Fraser is worth all the hype and Aronofsky is one of the best filmmakers around."

However, while I found the 2017 It adaptation to be a fantastic film, the necessary second part fell short after 45 minutes.  The second It movie, depicting the latter half of the novel, was masterfully done. The tension I felt in that first third of the movie (Chapter Two was a long film) is unparalleled. The perfect transition between the characters having suppressed their time in Derry and the full realization was masterful. It also established the secondary ability of Pennywise to befuddle the memories of adults who leave Derry perfectly.   That said, the film that had grabbed my attention raptly in the first 45 minutes slowly waned in the middle act of flashbacks, and lost my attention fully in the final third act. It felt like the ending of the first film in redux, but with more emotional weight attached.  I will admit that I haven't read the original novel, and I fully intend to when budget permits. I have no doubt that every effort possible was made to make a faithful adaption of the novel in the making of these films. I might as well be criticizing the latter half of the novel at the same time I'm criticizing the second film.   Having only seen the 2017 film and its 2019 sequel, I have to view it in that context. I loved the 2017 film, but the sequel is a compelling follow up that doesn't quite stick the landing. From what I understand, this isn't a major departure from most of Stephen King's books, so I guess my review is pretty generic in that regard."

With no other options, the protagonists have to go rogue.   It's a movie that insists on showing us that the big corporation which had people murdered and attempted to steal 32 billion from the Police pension fund just got a government bailout at the end of the movie, being too big to fail.   It's a movie that has a credit sequence dedicated to showing the audience what a Ponzi scheme is, and how absurd was the AIG government bailout.  Then, 5 years later, Adam McKay drops The Big Short, about how the utter corruption within the financial industry, and how collusion between government and private agencies led to the 2008 crash and the subsequent government bailouts. He's hitting the same theme on the head that he tried to do with the other guys, only this time in a serious mold.  I just find it hilarious how he had this idea, tried to say it in a comedy (ended up making one of the best comedies of the decade) then expanded that idea on a serious high-brow oscar contender starring Christian Bale and a boatload of other serious people.  What I'm trying to say with this, is don't go chasing waterfalls."

On the other hand there's nothing all that new narratively, Sid isn't funny despite Leguizamo giving it his all, honestly the movie in general is more mildly chuckleworthy than hilarious, and the other saber tooth villains are kind of dull and underwritten.  Also yes that baby isn't cute despite how the movie keeps insisting he is nor has the animation really held up (Some shots look fine while others look nearly Foodfight-esque).  But yeah it's not bad or horrible just nothing that special which is probably why this franchise, despite how many of them there are and how much money they made, never really got the cultural impact that Shrek or any of the Pixar movies or Frozen or Despicable Me or Encanto got, at least as far as the United States is concerned.

        "body": "I don't know what I expect to come from this, but my wife and I enjoy going to the movies, trying to go once a week \\[though the beginning of the year was a little bit light on good stuff to see\\]. I sort of wish the AMC app would let us rank our movies throughout the year, so I decided to instead do it here.  Full disclosure: Our local theater has a bar, so I've almost always had a double black with coke, at any movie I've seen.  # Best of the Year [Ranked in Order]  * **The Menu -** Went into this one expecting a generic thriller that took place at a private dining experience, and got so much more. I don't know if I would have enjoyed the movie as much if I hadn't been to such a dining experience in the past, and left wondering wait, why do people enjoy this crap? * **X -** To me 2022 felt like the year of taking movies that should be generic thrillers/horror and doing something new and fun with them. X was silly. . .And it was self aware, and it did exactly what it was supposed to. * **Top Gun: Maverick** \\- Everyone loves Top Gun, but Maverick felt like it was not only able to stand on its own, and would have been a good movie without any of the references \\[though probably wouldn't have hit the same box office marks\\], but that it hit every mark that it needed to in order to get our nostalgia heartstrings pumping.  # I Enjoyed it and Would Watch Again  * **Glass Onion -** I guess actually I need to watch it again, because somebody pulled the fire alarm at the movie right as Daniel Craig started his I know who did it! speech. . .So yea, now I need to rewatch the whole thing to see the last 15 minutes, but I'm not necessarily mad about it. * **Bullet Train** \\- It was fun and hit all the right notes. Now that it's on Netflix I really want to rewatch it high and see what's up. * **Bodies Bodies Bodies -** When I saw Pete Davidson was in this I thought it was going to be a very different movie and didn't expect it to be anywhere near as fun as it actually was. * **The Lost City -** The movie was exactly what the trailers said it would be. It was fun, it was silly, and it was cheesy. But sometimes we need that - All of us. * **The Unbearable Weight of Massive Talent** * **Bros** \\- I know this one didn't get a lot of good buzz but I really enjoyed it. At times it felt like the cinematography was a bit off, and it felt more like little vignettes more than a feature length movie, but overall it was fun. * **The Black Phone -** This hits a lot of the same notes as The Menu and X. * **Pearl** \\- A nice followup to X, and I loved the Wizard of Oz vibes, but I don't think it stands up at the same level. * **Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness -** As someone who grew up on Sam Raimi horror at an age way earlier than I probably should have been shown Army of Darkness, I think this resonated with me a lot more than it did with other people.  # Enjoyed far More Than I Expected  * **Elvis** \\- I've been thoroughly enjoying most of the biopics coming out of Hollywood lately, but I have no connecting to Elvis and mostly only went because my wife wanted to go. Ended up feeling like it was a little long, but wasn't at all mad about it. * **Dog** \\- I went in expecting a mostly generic movie, but walked out really liking the message. * **Sonic The Hedgehog 2**  \\- I think the first one was better, but I still enjoyed it. * **Fall** \\- As someone who hates heights more than anything, I spent the entire movie cringing in my seat. I'm sure it's not the greatest movie in the world, and I've definitely seen those twists happen before, but if a movie can make me feel the way this felt, I can't exactly call it bad. * **Scream -** There were certainly parts where I was rolling my eyes, like the point where horror movies always seem to have that the bad guy is down, and we should kill him, but lets talk instead, and now one of us is going to die, but I mostly think they did a good job with the update. * **Amsterdam -** The movie was long and it felt long, but I think it was a hell of a lot better than I expected it to be.  # Enjoyed it, but Probably Wouldn't Watch Again  * **Everything Everywhere All at Once -** It was fun. It was silly, but I don't think it was as incredibly as everybody else seems to think it is. If it's any consolation, my wife was in love. * **Ticket to Paradise** \\- Hit a lot of the same notes as The Lost City, but it felt like it ended on the wrong note and could have shaved a good 15 minutes from the runtime and been a better movie. * **Nope** \\- People love this one. My wife loves this one. I don't hate this one, I just have no interest in seeing it again. * **Thor: Love and Thunder -** It's the funny and silly Thor we've come to expect ever since Ragnarok, and I know some people are over it, but I enjoyed it. Though the movie was long and I wouldn't want to sit through it again. * **The Batman** \\- To me, the movie felt longer than it should have been and that it tried to do too much with its run time. I remember sitting in the theater and thinking, This is a natural stopping point, but than having to spend another hour watching more. I think I would have enjoyed this far better if The Batman was split into a 2 part movie to be fleshed out further. * **The Bob's Burgers Movie** \\- Anytime animated shows get pushed to the big screen I feel like the formula that makes them work feels off, and I don't think this was any different for me. * **Minions: The Rise of Gru** \\- It was cute, and I laughed. Though there was definitely a 15 minute portion in the middle I fell asleep during. * **The Northman** \\- It was a good movie, but a long movie. I didn't realize it was directed by Robert Eggers until I mentioned to my wife afterwards that it felt a hell of a lot like The Lighthouse - - -And then there was a fake mall shooting and we ran for our lives, so my recollection of the movie is. . .Tainted?  # The Mediocre Movie I Expected it to be  * **Uncharted -** I love the games, and this felt like a generic National Treasure sequel, but it's also pretty much exactly what I went into the movie expecting. * **Black Panther: Wakanda Forever -** I fully enjoyed the tribute to Chadwick Boseman, but the overall movie felt too long, and the storylines felt like they clashed more than they built off of each other. * **Black Adam -** I've become a little disillusioned with most DC movies so I didn't expect too much. So maybe it was slightly above my expectation. * **Where the Crawdads Sing -** Really loved the book, and while I enjoyed the film, I don't think it necessarily did the book justice at all. The movie had a firm beginning and end, but it didn't do enough to setup any of the important relationships to make any of the story really feel strong. * **Don't Worry Darling -** I think this tried to hit a lot of the same notes as Men, but did it a lot better, though, I still thought the whole thing was long and convoluted. * **Beast -** Didn't hate it. Didn't love it. My time wasn't wasted, but my mind also wasn't blown. * **Halloween Ends -** I really enjoyed the first movie in the new trilogy, hated the second one, and this one felt somewhere between the two. * **Fantastic Beasts: The Secrets of Dumbledore -** Similar to Halloween this one felt like it fell between its two predecessors. I feel like the whole franchise had a Dumbledore problem that could have been solved with him having his own movie, but it was still a step up from the travesty of the second movie.  # Expected More and Left Disappointed  * **Violent Night** \\- I was hoping to get something more like Krampus. I never expected the movie to be amazing, or have a real message, but I did expect to be laughing in silly ways.  * **Jurassic World Dominion -** It was bad, that is all. * **Studio 666** \\-Again, I never expected this movie to be good, but I did expected it to be at least fun. And I didn't find it to be anything more than forgettable.  # Worst of the Year  * **Men -** I felt like this movie had a lot it wanted to try to say, and that there was a lot of heart behind trying to make a point, but that it just didn't succeed on any of those points. I left the theater with my wife imagining a Goose at the end of the tunnel making the signature tones. . And that thought alone was better than the whole movie. * **The Invitation** \\- I left the theater feeling like a dozen recent movies did what The Invitation tried to do, but better. It was basically Read or Not, but nowhere near as good.  # Hoping to See by the End of the Year  * Devotion * The Whale * Avatar * Babylon * I wanna Dance * A Man Called Otto"

I'm a big Aubrey Plaza fan and this is some of her best work I think. It's probably her juiciest and most complex dramatic role, and she does still get to use a bit of her trademark sarcasm that's so amusing. And all of the supporting performances are solid too. Theo Rossi in particular is good at being mysterious yet still likable.  The story and how it's presented reminded me of Uncut Gems, which I thoroughly enjoyed, but I liked the more low-key approach this took. The tension is still palpable but it's not nearly as loud and stress inducing. It makes everything seem so easy and matter of fact, making it easier to understand why Emily does what she does. In a way, I think this is a bit more realistic than Uncut Gems.  It's technically proficient as well. It's edited into a tight 90 minute package, and that combined with the cinematography find creative ways to capture the more frenetic moments. I hesitate to call them action sequences, but they kind of are, and regardless, this clearly had a pretty low budget, and doing those scenes couldn't have been easy.  I would've liked to see this in theaters, actually. I really dug it, and I'm glad to see it so high on the Netflix charts already."

There must have been a reason why he was there (though it's funny to imagine he's just a fan of youth track). In The Incredibles 2, he says that if he opened up to his parents about what happened, they would think he was hiding something. That comment could have a lot of implications, and I feel like something was supposed to come from that which we didn't end up getting to see. He demonstrates some things later that seem like they could be a trauma response from almost dying from the underminer. There's other stuff he says, but just generally I think there's a lot to his character that I wish we could have learned about."

So in the beginning of the weirdness, there was at least one attempt at a cover up that I remember, which was the first bacon breakfast. When he goes back and sees the place cleaned up, what was the point if ultimately the alts we're going to reveal themselves. Off the bat, I'm convinced the wife that went back with the real hubby was the Alt wife. Now as far as these alts, if they're real and this isn't some trippy hallucinations from the weed, how are they produced to look so much like the originals. I mean, they weren't just twins they were clones. So is this magic. The force shield definitely shows what we're seeing is real and not some imagination. Also, why have the patient files on the property; it was meant to be discovered. Mostly I was disappointed by the reveal of the alts; if they kept the psychological thriller aspect going the movie would have had a deeper meaning, instead we're just dealing with magical realism and things are too conveniently explained away."

Heard it was adopted from a short story so perhaps there were some heavy edits by the screenwriters.  **Stuff I cheered at:**  * Finally seeing an alternative Black girl giving that goth/emo/punk feel as the lead in a movie. There are so many girls like that but we still don't see them on screen.    * Also, she does cheerleading! We don't have to stick to stereotypical tropes. * Cool to have a movie centered around a relationship with two girls where romance isn't at the center of the drama. Conflict can be created over the most mundante things. * Better stories about grief and dying. It's not always sadness. There's a mix of emotions and we'll all experience it at some point. * Showing a healthy father/daughter relationship. Awesome to see a dad check in on their child, make dinner and be aware of stuff happening/people in her life.  **Stuff that made me scratch my head:**  * Why are we trying to develop friendship between an *obvious bully and outcast*? At the beginning, it is clear that Capri (the queen bee) goes out of her way to tease/torment Darby: >!calling her 'freak show', embarrasing her in class, stealing her clothes after Darby's showered.!<    * >!Nevermind, that they used to be friends and had mutual respect for their athletic abilities. Nevermind that she knows Darby's mother died when she was a kid. Nevermind that Darby isolates herself to protect herself from more bullying.!<    * >!Capri demands that Darby do what she wants and when Darby refuses, she plunges her head in a toilet. !<She keeps sabotages Darby until she gives in throughout the movie, never apologizing for the hell she put Darby through. * Why is she a free-of-charge social worker helping dead people move-on? >!She started doing this as a 6-year old and her father was okay with this? She never gets tired of this job though she never wants to talk about her own mom dying?!< * If we're going to have an 'alternative girl' character, can we do more than just show that she likes the color black? We hear some alternative rock in the movie but you don't see why she's interested in this culture. Just seeing dead people doesn't justify wearing black nearly all the time and then suddenly being okay with pastels after a makeover. * Unneeded romantic plot. >!Yes, Capri lost her boyfriend but why add a weird romance between him and Darby? Did she even like this guy? Their interaction was basically Darby giving free grief counseling. !<The plot by itself was interesting. * Obvious teen movie cliches: climbing social status in less than a month (the mean girls are suddenly letting her in the clique after hating her for several years), a nerdy boy having a glow up after middle school and becoming the 'hot boyfriend', ditzy/vain girls, immature/stupid boys,..."

        "body": "Let's get straight into it. RRR (Rise, Roar, Revolt) is a 3 hour long Indian movie that you absolutely *have* to watch. For a little context, RRR is a tollywood movie, which means that it's original language is Telugu which is spoken in a couple of states in the south of the country. Unlike what most of the world believes, all Indian movies are not Bollywood; that refers only to hindi language movies, and there are many languages in India.   It's hard to describe what this movie is about because it bends genres like there's no tomorrow. Its plot briefly is this - RRR is about two men living in colonial India. They work for opposite sides and are fated to be pitted against each other, but without knowing each other's true identity, they become the best of friends. This movie has elements of everything. It is an action, drama, rom com, musical and buddy comedy movie wrapped in one and it. is. amazing!!!  The director, SS Rajamouli has really created a masterpiece. Everything is perfection. The character and world building is done so perfectly that what usually would be ridiculous and cringey is completely believable and fun here. The characters are nuanced and insanely well acted. The directing, musical score and dancing are out of this world, and the rewatchablity value is high.   Yes, it may require a certain amount of suspension of disbelief and a big chunk of your day (3 hours) to get through, BUT if you can get past that and be accepting of a few cultural differences in movie making, I assure you, it is going to be a VERY rewarding experience. It's in my top 3 movies this year and maybe of all time just for the sheer enjoyable nature of the film. Go check it out!  EDIT: Here to boost my Watch RRR campaign (LOL) by adding that they have just been nominated for a golden globe in the best non English language film and best original song. Love that for Indian cinema!"

I know im probably not the first to make a post like this...  I know the ending is a contentious issue with some people, is he asleep, is he dreaming, we never see the top topple at any point and it's left ambiguous as to whether or not he is asleep. The main point that many sleepers point to is that the kids haven't grown and are wearing the same clothes. The awake crew focuses on the top bobbling, and that he finally sees their faces.  As someone watching this with a different perspective on life now that I have kids, I still believe that this is relaity at the ending, however I now fully understand those who state that no matter what, reality or the dream, Cobb doesn't care because he's with his children. And this struck a huge emotional cord with me that it didn't before, and I completely understand him not caring if the top fell over and running to his kids because at the end, thats all he wanted and all he fought for the entire film.   My best friends son died in his sleep last year at 11 months old, and I know the personal hell he and his wife went through and Contiue to go through .  If I could chose a world where I was with my kids over another one, real or not, I'd chose that one 100% of the time.

Wanton death and destruction in a desert wasteland, complete with culty marauders with a masked muscle-bound leather daddy leading them, a feral child, and DIY hotrods in a car chase fight.  I can barely imagine what happened between Mad Max and this that would change everything so much, but I really enjoy the speculation.  You can definitely see that Miller had a lot more money to make this film.  For what it is Mad Max is an excellent film with one of my now favorite villan performances and one of the best car jumps through another vehicle scenes every put to film.  The Road Warrior however, in my opinion, is the superior film simply because the story moves so much more quickly and precisely, and the world itself is built in a way that you can almost feel the desperation of its inhabitants.  It is by no means perfect and there is one part in the film that I could honestly do without, but I chalk that up to my personal sensibilities.  What are your honest thoughts on The Road Warrior?"

A part I remember the most is a part where they enter this “town” that had a rule that you weren't allowed to smile. Then they get into this dance/ musical number and at the end of the song, the kids smile. Because of this, they get put into a cage. Another specific thing I remember was their “jail food” was served in this big wooden bowl and a wooden spoon. This is so freaking random and terribly explained but if anyone can find this movie, it would be unreal.  Other things about the movie: - was made roughly in the years from 2009 and before, since that was when I watched it  - the movie COULD be Aussie (since I'm from Australia and it could've have been some niche children's special in Australia.

The animation is fun and immersive. The music is also pretty good (i really liked the spanish harmonies with the electric guitar).  Thing is, this movie can be really dark and mature if it wants to be, and can hit you in the face with it's tense scenes. The way it handles Puss In Boot's relation to death is surprisingly dark and realistic and will definitely get children frightened. Two of my favourite scenes are the ones that touch on this side of the movie. One being the intorduction of wolfy boy which was shivering, and the other being a scene where PIB straight up has a panic attack. These scenes in themself are worth a watch in my opinion.  The unfortunate part is that the movie has an awful sense of humor like 85% of the time, and besides those scenes i mentioned above, it constantly drops jokes like every 5th sentence. And it's not just the comic relief character that does it...Literally everyone except wolfy boy. Wolfy boy has zero jokes in this movie, which gives the whole experience a bipolar up and down feeling with him being on the screen (which are the best parts of the movie tbh) and off. It wouldn't frustrate me this much usually, but DAMN...This movie could have been on another level and just way more coherent if it had just tuned it's humorous tone down and tried to come up with better jokes. Some of them kinda hit tho, but not many for sure. This also doesn't help with getting to like the main trio, but luckily some scenes got me attached to them by the end.  The movie left me liking it in general. I would even go as far as saying that this is the best animated movie of the year (even though we didn't have too many good ones).  Critics and people in general are gonna love it. Go and watch it!"

Due, to its rising popularity in sales of this toy, most of the retail stores were sold out and this father went and had this ongoing feud with this mail post office carrier who he was a father himself who's trying to get the toy.     Really fun and enjoyed this comedy family friendly film and noticed that a pro wrestler Big Show was in the movie portrayed as Giant Santa in that Warehouse brawl scene.

But despite my stance of being problematic isn't the end of the world I find myself taken aback by things in older favorites I never noticed before.   The new Indy 5 trailer got me excited to watch the originals again. They've always been favorites but I realized I hadn't sat down to watch them through in some time.   Suffice it to say I was floored to see straight up yellow face in Raiders. A white stunt man with prosthetics made up to look Asian. I've seen Raiders dozens of times yet somehow never noticed until now.   It threw me for a loop, to be honest. There is also brown face in the film.   I will always consider Raiders one of my favorite films ever. Temple of Doom, which is more controversial, is my favorite Indy film period.   But I won't lie that these poorly aged elements aren't something of a sore spot to grudgingly get past.   I want to make it clear that I'm not talking about canceling anything nor am do I want this to devolve into a screed about political correctness and anti-wokeness.

I told my roommate who was choosing with me, She told me to read the bio and immediately i thought i wouldnt want to watch that. A man finds out his wife has been fantasising with another man and sets out in an orgasmic journey... - something like that.   But alright. Let's watch.  The start was definitely in line with what i expected. Straight out with nudity and superficial talk, jealousy, the potential man of the wife's fantasies...  What i didnt expect was how captivated i was by such slow scenes. The plot is outlandish but believable at the same time, the characters act normally (for the most part), the dialogue, the performances are incredible! The interactions, the looks, the back and forth. I thought this part was great.   However, the true masterpiece is in the entire setting.   The combination of the lighting, the MUSIC, with the things i just mentioned meshed together to create one of the best movie experiences i've ever had.   The piano made me Cringe every time it played.   They didnt give out too much information to maintain the suspense which is also in line with the vibe of the film, the secrecy of the organization and such.   I was constantly under the impression that this did not give me a fincher vibe... If i had to Guess, given i hadnt seen anything like that before, id say it was Kubrick from what i had heard about him, but i was pretty sure i had seen fincher at the start... Alas, i didnt, i mustve misclicked and mistakenly, and thankfully, introduced myself to Stanley Kubrick's work.    What a masterpiece"

        "body": "I don't post in this sub often and realize some subs have insane rules/regulations, so I'll keep relatively short and then add more later. Also, I've noticed on Reddit in general if something goes against popular consensus to any degree, people don't respond with thoughtful feedback but just downvote or even try to get a post banned.  Re-watched Get Out for the first time since its release and recognized its strengths more easily this second go-around. I remembered very little other than the main plot points and general themes.  The concepts of slavery and white envy of black physicality were innovative and thoughtful, if perhaps too obvious thematically and not particularly deep. Get Out also approached the perspective of how woke liberals contribute to modern-day racism by convincing themselves they are not racist and re-appropriating black culture in different ways, definitely worth exploring.  However, the film is all over the place in terms of tone (not the first time I've heard this complaint); it's a horror/satire/social commentary/sci-fi/thriller mish-mash that works most, but not all, of the time. The above themes are introduced well in the first two acts, but the third act turns into a sci-fi thriller less concerned about race and more about survival.  The humor initially struck me as repetitive: How many times can a character insist his friend has become a sex slave? Even though the character's making a point about actual slavery, it still gets stale.  The fact that I've thought so much about the movie, and especially how its themes translate to real-life liberal culture, is a testament to its power. It's very interesting to me to see how others think the movie takes place in a red state or that the Armitrage (sic?) family is somehow brainwashed.  Which leads me to my final point, which I know will cause some controversy. Every single white character in this movie is evil or awful. From what I recall about Us and Nope, that's largely the case as well. This is fine if the antagonists are well-developed, but they seem more like plot devices than actual people.  Basically, I think this is like an 8.5/10 movie -- but is often boosted in terms of reception because it arrived at such a culturally relevant time (when Trump came into office).  I can't help but compare it to Kathryn Bigelow's Detroit, which arrived around the same time and was basically a horror movie about the Detroit Riots in the 1960s. That movie was flawed, too (have to rewatch, but there was a white savior complex aspect) -- but I felt it was much more intense and showcased stronger writing, as well as deeper characters. My reaction to that was very visceral; I remember leaving the theater thinking This is the best movie of the year.  **EDIT:** I don't remember Us other than the scissors and scratchy voice and the final image. Nope was super meh and really cheated us out of a Charla Nash comedy. What a thoughtful discussion this was. I leave you with these two top comments from the New York Times' Best Movies of 2022 article -- which, if it makes you happy, saw Nope claim the No. 1 spot.  You know you're allowed to criticize Jordan Peele, right? We don't need to pretend that the epically lackluster Nope is as good as his other films. If someone said Get Out was the third best movie the year it came out, yeah that would make sense. But Nope was just bad.  Nope? Are you serious? The movie is illogical and silly, if anyone else had directed it you would be awarding it razzies. The characters do not grow or change--indeed, they are barely characters at all, with a goal (selling a photo??) that is absurd and unrealistic. The cruel, unnecessary scene with the monkey is disconnected to the story of the film--it is backstory to a side character that is barely in the film. Much of the film is too dark to see what's happening; the dialogue is mush-mouthed, and oblique to the point of being incomprehensible. The creature design is little more than a classic flying saucer with a hole in the bottom. There are no moments of emotion, or tension; the rules they establish are instantly violated with zero ramifications; and the ending is a cheat. No just a bad movie, but easily one of the worst movies I've seen in years, it makes US look coherent. I've never disagreed with the two of you more."

Even poor Mary Elizabeth Manstrantion got her one big scene, where she goes from being the normal one to being just as wacko with no explanation.   The best performance, in my mind, came from Michelle Pfeiffer as Elvira. She seemed to be the only one taking it seriously, adding subtlety to her character, but that only makes Pacino's overacting more obvious when they share scenes together.   Good comedy but not a good movie. I think this was a hit because it was entertaining to see and extremely violent."

        "body": "After having finally getting around to watching it, I can say it's definitely one of my favorite movies that I've watched all year. The movie managed to keep me on my heels the whole time with its constant pace, yet never managed to feel like a rushed film.  I feel as if every main actor executed their role well, especially Javier and JLaw.   Javier managed to portray a narcissistic obsessed creator, who disregarded the trouble strangers brought to his wife, who in this case is Mother Nature, and forgave and welcomed them as they kept coming. In the bible we also frequently see just how much God himself claims to be a jealous God, who wants his creation to give thanks and praise him, and though it may seem unfair to his wife, having the burden of continuously forgiving the people who are damaging your home, must bring upon lots of strain and isn't for the weak. We see how Javier couldn't care less about Earth (home), because just like in the bible,  Gods creation of humans are the most important to him, and the Earth we live on will soon be anew, hence the reason why we see a new girl at the end of the movie.   As for JLaw, her performance was amazing. Her constant panic and hyperventilating kept me on edge the whole movie, and it didn't let me slip away once. In this film she is seen as Mother Nature and how humans are constantly destroying and tearing her apart, with little to no thought of it at all. Her battle with the strangers that destroy her home, resemble the damage people on Earth do today. One of the things that stood out to me the most, is she doesn't look for the help of strangers at all. She hesitates and feels uneasy when Michelle's character was assisting her with laundry, told the one person who was 'helping' her paint, how it wasn't necessary in the slightest, and she kept exclaiming how she renovated that house all by herself. This lines up with our real life, because Mother Nature would only benefit with us out of the equation. Jennifer would thrive if it was just her and her husband left in the house, where he wasn't responsible and didn't interfere with the house construction.   I will say though, I like the relationship established between Jennifer and Javier. Since the concept of there being a Mother Nature in a biblical sense doesn't exist, Javier being God has the power to end and create a new Earth, which would be classified to us as a Mother Nature/Earth. We see this at the end when he ends Jennifers life and a different woman wakes up to him. As much power as Mother Earth has, she is inferior to God at all moments. God's creation covers over Earth and people.   To cover some of the other allegories and allusions, Ed and Michelle are a reflection of Adam and Eve and how as soon as they broke the stone (Forbidden Fruit), they were banished from the private room they kept in the house, just like in the bible Adam and Eve were banished from the garden. Their offspring Cain and Able are also depicted when one of their sons die due to head bashing of the doorknob (rock), which may or may not be the same doorknob that was broken off by Javier earlier in the film. The rush of people claiming to gain power when the house transitioned to an apocalyptic setting, also symbolizes the antichrist and how people will rush to claim power, when Jesus comes back and the markings they will put on people for following them  Overall I appreciated this movie a lot. I didn't think the meaning behind it was too complex for the average movie goer to not enjoy. I was scared that this was going to be a forced  pretentious film, but it wasn't at all. If you did think it was pretentious, I would like to know why"

I think this is one advantage shows have over movies, and more specifically ones from this century. I'm not talking about cult classics or films released 25-30+ years ago (some even 80 years) that are still in people's mouths to this day, but moreso this century since these past 2 decades have been the golden age of television.   I see the most popular films from the last 5 years and the most popular shows from the past 5 years and you'd immediately realize there are more shows being talked about than movies. Even take subreddits for example: How many big subreddits dedicated to shows have you seen? Then compare that to how many subreddits dedicated to certain movies, barely any if none apart from franchises.   Are there any movies you know that have a big loyal fan base which are still talked about? I'm obviously not talking about films from this year."

Michael Myers should have been killed by the mob in Halloween Kills (with some other changes) 9. Halloween Resurrection is a fun and entertaining movie 10. The original Friday the 13th isn't good and the 2009 remake is miles better 11. Jaws is a little overrated 12. The Babadook is not a good movie 13. Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom is amazing 14. The Lost World: Jurassic Park & Jurassic World Dominion are the only bad Jurassic movies 15. Psychological horror is the worst subgenre of horror movies 16. Halloween Ends is the worst halloween movie and I hate it with a burning passion 17. Chucky has never had a bad movie (which means I like Seed of Chucky) 18. The new Texas Chainsaw Massacre is really fun and I love it 19. Scream 4 is the best Scream movie 20. The Predator (2018) isn't nearly as bad as people say (except the autism subplot i still really hate that) 21. the Child's Play remake is a pretty good movie 22. Andrew garfield is the best spiderman 23. everything about the original Spider-Man movie is awful 24. the green goblin (the character in general) is the worst spiderman villain 25. Venom(2018) is an awesome movie 26. Home Alone 6 is pretty good 27. Home alone 3 is pretty good 28.

The bluray only has the DC and unrated, so between those two which do people prefer? I've heard the DC is darker in tone (which is totally fine by me) and its 10 minutes shorter. The untated version is closer to the theatrical version's tone, but adds a lot of unnecessary scenes back in.  Thoughts?"

Throughout the film, we see how the characters on the bullet train are all trapped in their own little bubbles, locked in a battle for survival with no regard for the lives of others. They are driven by their own selfish desires, whether it be for money, revenge, or personal gain.  But as the movie progresses, we see how their actions only serve to escalate the violence and chaos on the train. They are caught in a never-ending cycle of violence, with each act of aggression only leading to more retaliation and bloodshed.  In the end, the only ones who truly benefit from this chaos are the shadowy figures pulling the strings behind the scenes. They are the ones who profit from the destruction and pain of others, using their power and influence to manipulate the situation to their own advantage.  Through its portrayal of this destructive cycle of violence, Bullet Train serves as a warning against the dangers of unchecked power and the futility of violence as a means of solving problems. It reminds us that in a world where everyone is out for themselves, only the ruthless and the powerful will thrive.  So while some may see Bullet Train as just another action-packed thriller, I believe it has a deeper message about the dangers of unbridled aggression and the importance of empathy and compassion in a world that is becoming increasingly chaotic and unpredictable   What are your thoughts?

        "body": "As most are aware, there's been an increased push for more strong female leads and roles all around in Hollywood over the last decade or so. While I think this is obviously an overdue and noble pursuit, it's often resulted in studios going for badass girl-boss type characters while failing to write them as complex and multi-faceted. Certainly a step up from classic damsel in distress type roles females often occupied in many genres in the past, but this approach often results in flat roles that put female characters on an unrealistic pedestal that ultimately, in my opinion, fail to advance feminist ideals in the industry even though the intentions are good.  Certainly not the only approach, but one step I think screenwriters could take to create a more well-rounded diet for actresses today would be to attempt to write more great female villains. One of my favorite female performances of all time is Tilda Swinton in Michael Clayton. She's a cold embodiment of corporate greed and perfectly portrays the evil force in the world today of putting profits over people, but at the same time a convincingly flawed human dealing with her own internal struggles and anxieties. Absolute masterclass in acting as well as writing.  Just wanted to get the discussion started on this issue as I find it interesting from an artistic as well as sociological perspective, hope it's not too hot-button and sparks more of a discussion than debate. I'd love to hear any thoughts people have on what they'd like to see in the future of strong female roles in Hollywood or in the spirit of my example, some of their favorite female antagonists. Thanks for reading.

        "body": "*Mild spoilers for the film below*  I'm sure I'm not the only one who gave this 3.5hr 'exploration of a Belgian housewife's chores' a go in response to the BFI poll, where it's rocketed straight up to number one, and it's left me wondering *why now*? Citizen Kane, Vertigo, both hugely influential and uncontentious challengers for the top spot, but Jeanne Dielman is an achingly slow, experimental film that would put off your average viewer, whereas I think most of the other films on the list have at least some mainstream appeal alongside their artistic merit.  First, my impressions. I genuinely did enjoy the film and I definitely wouldn't say it's boring, at times it can become almost hypnotic like the rhythmic beat of train tracks going by. It's not entertaining exactly, but as long as you're in the mood for something a little more leisurely and contemplative then it's an easy enough watch. A rewarding one too.  Quick overview… we see our housewife going about her daily life in painstaking detail. A routine clearly refined over time down to mechanical precision. All her actions seem automated and perfunctory, with very little joy or expression, she's living largely to the beat of economic necessity. In focussing so closely on such minutia though we start to notice off-beats creep in. Her growing malaise, or perhaps frustration, is not depicted with emotional outbursts or verbal tirades, but instead with subtle shifts in her actions and mannerisms that convey her inner state. This is where the 'monotony' of the first day's routine pays off, as by familiarising ourselves with her fastidiousness, a later hair out of place or pot lid askew becomes as overt as a gun shot in any other film. Even that prolonged potato peeling scene becomes engaging; the sheer level of intimacy and familiarity we've developed forces empathy and you *feel* the apathy and weary resignation with which she goes about her task. There's a strong sense that the film is building to something but you're not quite sure what, which produces a 'soft tension' that keeps you engrossed.  In terms of themes, it obviously has a lot to say about the role of woman in society and I don't want to diminish or dismiss that message at all. However, I'm sure that particular theme has been talked about at length many times over, and that message was as true and pertinent in 2012 and 2002 (etc) as it is today, so personally I don't think it's why it's taken the top spot. Instead, I'm wondering if covid, and particularly lockdowns and other disruptions have pushed Jeanne Dielman to newfound relevance (finally getting to the point of this ramble XD).  Arguably the most profound impact of covid is that our own routines have been disrupted, and I think that's forced a lot of people to take stock of their lives. When living day to day, as Jeanne Dielman does, it's so easy to sink into comforting habits that carry you along. It's all too rare that we stop to consider our own satisfaction, sense of purpose or ambitions, they're sacrificed for a sense of reassuring predictability. Even as the mundanity wears us down though, we often don't notice until it becomes so prominent it warrants a label; stress, burnout, depression. I think covid brought to light a growing dissatisfaction with that way of life, a realisation that something, *anything*, has to change as humans aren't automatons. We can't dutifully perform the same tasks day in, day out without pause. Like Jeanne, eventually something has to give or else we break.  I think that's what I took from the film. A reminder to take some time to evaluate our own routines and life direction, and to consider whether it's taking us somewhere we want to go. Not that we're always given that level of agency of course, economic necessity plays a large role here too, but then that speaks to wider issues in society. Of course this probably isn't the film's original vision, but I hate to admit that I did resonate with the forced monotony of it all. I've certainly had long periods when I've coasted along without much thought until something derailed me, and then I've been amazed it didn't happen sooner. I guess every now and then, it's worth taking a stab at something new!"

As to what counts as a blockbuster? I guess in theory a blockbuster ought to actually be successful, but just anything that's trying to be a blockbuster ought to count, in some sense.  I know some people find best and favourite to be different things, so if that's you, understand the following as my favourite:  * Inception * Casino Royale * Thor: Ragnarok * Interstellar * Inside Out * The Batman * Edge of Tomorrow * Ratatouille  * Toy Story 3 * Unstoppable  I also really liked Bullet Train but I maybe watched that too recently."

        "body": "I feel like it's been a common fact that nobody can create a sense of true adventure like LucasFilm Ltd. can.  I'm watching this to prep for the new Disney+ series, which looks masterful and epic. But I've always heard of this film, and I love Ron Howard (since I'm in the small minority who loves Solo: A Star Wars Story), so after watching this in its entirety, I'm happy to say that this was a lot of fun and I really liked how simplistic of a film it was. It wasn't too dense, but it was filled with personality and goofiness that had me feel nostalgic for old-school fantasy epics.  Warwick Davis is a living legend and he is instantly likable and charming as Willow Ufgood. Val Kilmer looks like he's having so much fun as Madmartigan, and Joanna Whitney is badass as Sorsha. I also really liked Jean Marsh as the wicked Queen Bavmorda. The rest of the supporting cast is also really solid, especially the Brownies, who were legitimately funny. The overall story and execution of this film is really interesting since at times it's super fun and lighthearted, then there are moments where it's straight up creepy and terrifying. Howard did a superb job at balancing these elements, and made for something unique.  The production design and editing is really good, and the writing is also great. The pacing in the first half is a bit slower than I expected, but it ramped up as the film continues. The visual effects and the practical effects were decent, however, there are many times where it looks extremely dated. Like, how the Brownie's green screen effect shows at times, and when a certain scene where Raziel gets knocked down, I could clearly see it's a stunt actress with a old woman mask on. I could give things like this a pass, but they were super noticeable. Also, rest in peace to composer, James Horner. This score is one of his best and is super catchy to the point of me humming the theme to myself afterwards.  Overall, what a mystical and wonderful film. Now, I'm ready for the legacy series.  What did you guys think about this film?"

        "body": "Ahh, there's nothin' quite like early 2000's Disney. I have a weird history with this film since I would always see the trailer for it before watching one of those classic Disney DVDs with “Disney FastPlay”. It looked cool and reminiscent to Atlantis: The Lost Empire, but I never got a chance to watch it. Until now…  In a nutshell, this animated film has a very ambitious world where there's creatures and animals as a pirate crew with a talking robot and a blob that can morph into tiny versions of things. Just tons of odd ideas that somehow became cool as the film continues, even to the fact that I've never seen a pirate sci-fi adventure ever on film. It's clear that the novel and animators worked their butt off, creating a world in one film and executing it in a fun way. It's not perfect since there are some semi-annoying things in it, I'm just happy Disney made something super unique.  The voice acting is really solid, and I recognized quite a bit of them like Joseph Gordon-Levitt, Martin Short, Emma Thompson, and Michael Wincott. The characters are mostly really good, but for me, John Silver might be one of the most complex characters in Disney history. He's an antagonist for most of this film, but he has a really good heart and is a sort of surrogate father figure to Jim Hawkins. I really loved his character development, and he really was the strongest character in the whole film for me. The only characters that kind of made me annoyed was B.E.N. and Morph, while I think Martin Short is hilarious, he just was used way too much and I didn't really care that much about Morph.  The score by James Newton Howard is absolutely incredible, and I can't help but love the use of that 2000s pop rock. Especially “I'm Still Here (Jim's Theme)”, what a track! The use of CGI and 2D animated, while a bit dated, paints this imaginative world well. But there are times where CGI pops in, and it's super jarring. The writing is fine, but the relationship between Jim Hawkins and John Silver holds this film together. I love the use of orange and blue coloring in this, it's super ethereal and wonderful. The pacing was decent, but I felt some of the humor didn't land for me. Lastly, the third act is very bombastic and visually astonishing, but I just felt like there needed to be a bit more. It just felt a tiny bit underwhelming.  But overall, this was definitely a pleasant experience. Glad I got to see it.  What did you guys think about this film?"

I mean cmon...in 2006 he was a depressed teenager with very little diologue in Little Miss Sunshine and 1 year later worked alongside DDL in There will be Blood and absolutely held his own with one of the greatest ever? That's a feat very few could do.  Second is Travis Fimmel. This man was a damn underwear model....AN UNDERWEAR MODEL. I have no idea how he nailed the lead role in Vikings, but anyone who has watched the show will tell you how good he is. I've been watching film for 31 years and I can confidently say Travis's performance in the show was some of the greatest acting I've ever seen in cinema. I almost don't want to call it acting because I'm convinced he WAS Ragnar Lothbrok. I'm sure this is also in part due to the fantastic writing of the show and his character development."

It probably shouldn't have been released in theaters. It should've been a Netflix movie and it would've done a lot better. I would've seen this in theaters ten years ago when the cost of seeing a movie was $8 instead of $20. Nowadays if I pay for movies in theaters, it needs to be something like Dune. People just don't know how to behave in theaters anymore, and I find theaters pretty grimy anyway. Lounge seating was not the move.   If you want a few good laughs, I recommend it."

As a Bay film, I basically had zero expectations and the mixed reviews didn't do nothing to help that. Still I gave it a try , and was totally surprised at how I ended up liking it. Not a perfect film but liked the performances, action scenes and basically it was entertaining.   Another one was The Lost City. Maybe it's cuz of Brad Pitt's cameo, I ended up loving it, more than I thought I would. Felt different from the more CGI filled blockbusters of the modern era.  There are other films that would have surprised me if I hadn't seen any reviews like Everything Everywhere All At Once and Top Gun Maverick."

Literally within 2 scenes I wasn't sure if it was a fake movie. I'm still not sure.  The BEST thing I can say about it is that I wasn't bored (because I was in shock at how bad every aspect of the movie was), but I strongly suggest taking an edible beforehand to help it into the so bad it's actually super funny territory. I did not do this and I have regrets.  Did anyone else watch this movie and have a different takeaway? Should be near the top of the Razzie Award list, without a doubt.

And after watching it, all three and a half hours of it, I am convinced that it is a massive troll campaign.  Gut Opinion: Why would I want to see a woman peeling potatoes on film in real time  when I can watch a woman peeling potatoes at home?  Nothing happens in the movie. It is not ellipsis or exaggeration, absolutely nothing happens. It is a woman doing her daily life in real time. Seeing her wash the dishes, cook, eat with her son, go shopping, the only thing that comes out of the ordinary is that she does sex work, but that's part of that routine.  There is no conflict except in the last twenty minutes, the woman must find a button for her son's jacket that was sent to her by her aunt who lives in Canada.  And here is the big problem; there is no stylization; i.e, reality is not filtered or paraphrased, there is no work of mimesis, it is unaltered daily life, there is an ellipsis of time, if it didn't, the film would last seventy-two hours, but it pretends not to, by showing the actions in real time.  The second is ; in other slow and boring films the actions are loaded, that is, there is a great purpose, they are directed towards an end, that is why we put up with them. Here, they do not have that end. It is the absolute ennui.  And what is more French than that?  On the second day things go wrong, the coffee does not taste good and the woman prepares it again, but there is no reason for it, there is a whole level of inner life that is completely alien to us, we do not know the reason for the action in the literally last eighth minute, and in the last seven minutes the woman is just sitting at the dining room table.  The only extraordinary action, which would have any kind of impact on her life from that moment on, just happens.  Jeanne Dielman, 23 quai du Commerce, 1080 Bruxelles cannot be the greatest movie of all time because it lacks two things that every movie should have; stylization and conflict.  The message of the panel that gave it such a distinction is that the best story that cinema can tell is none, it is to be a mere portrait of reality, without altering, without commenting, without stylizing, without glamorizing, without editing. And as such, any interpretation or allegory is valid because the film is like a cloud. When you are doing a daily and repetitive action your mind wanders off. Any comment or review, then, will not be about the film itself, but about the person who tells you about it and their idiosyncrasy.  &#x200B;  If you want to see feminism, it will be there because you brought it.   I am aware that by writing this I am telling you something about myself. and that is the artistic intention.   But I think the purpose of cinema is telling stories and take us to the realm of the extra-ordinary.  If I wanted ordinary I have a lot of it at home."

Even if you're against the idea of a sequel... we all know shameless sequels get made regardless( Kindergarten Cop 2). So I'm surprised Phone Booth has gone untouched. Especially considering the similarities it shares with Saw; both take place in few locations, both feature an unseen killer playing games with the protagonist, and both have a twist ending where the killer gets away.   Personally, I think sequels for this film COULD work. Maybe following along with Saw; have multiple victims in phone booths at one time who have to work together. Maybe have a 'Phone Booth Game' akin to Dirty Harry. Heck, maybe evolve it to a mobile phone or something in later sequels. I think the killer was interesting enough to carry a few more movies."

Given that the failure of Sergei Bondarchuk's *Waterloo* (1970) (which is a great film, nonetheless) was one of the catalysts of Kubricks original project being cancelled, do you think there is any possibility of this getting made after Scott's upcoming *Napoleon* (especially if it turns out to be a success)?  Also, on a similar note, Scott's *Napoleon* is the first such historical epic about him in years. If this does turn out to be widely successful (ignoring the lukewarm response to his *Last Duel*), do you think it will lead to another cycle of historical epics?  &#x200B;  EDIT: Thanks for the comments. I was thinking more about a possible revival of the project, perhaps in the form of the long mooted HBO series.  Obviously, it won't correspond exactly to Kubrick's original intention (especially the spectacle side of things - e.g. battle sequences -  which would most likely need a lot of CGI), but at least the project will have technically been made in a sense. Plus, given the Napoleonic era is so history-rich, a miniseries is probably the better option if you want to show his entire life and not cut too much out.  Regarding Kubrick's intended vision, I'd imagine any potential director would need to get the family's approval, etc. around certain things (let alone viewing the existing material), so the final product might not be too bad if things go well."

One thing that stood out to me was the characters referring to one another as dog or in other canine ways. Throughout the first two acts, there are multiple instances where Thomas Wake refers to Thomas Howard/Ephraim Winslow as a dog. The first mention is when Wake asserts his power to Howard, telling Howard that he'll do whatever he tells him to and he'll like it cuz I says you will! Contradict me again, and I'll dock your wages. Swab, dog, swab. Later, Howard reveals to Wake that when he was working as a logger that goddamned Canady bastard \\[the real Ephraim Winslow\\] always called me a dog. A filthy dog. I'll show you a dog. I'll show you whose a dog. This anecdote makes it clear to the audience, and evidently to Wake, that this term gets under Howard's skin. The term represents the power other people exert onto Howard, a man who yearns for the day he can be free from obligation and dependence. Later, when Howard recounts the death of the real Ephraim Winslow, we remarks that the last thing he yelled to him was Tom, you dog! During one of the film's major turning points when Wake confronts Howard about killing the gull and Howard denies it, Wake shouts that he is a murdering dog! Twas what changed the wind on us. Twas ye what damned us, dog. Twas ye! Moments later, Wakes continues his verbal assault, telling Howard that Winslow were right! Thomas, ye're a dog! A filthy dog! A dog! It is upon the delivery of this line that Pattinson's character lunges at Dafoe's, sending them sprawling onto the wooden floor. After Howard leaves Wake in a huddled in pain on the floor, he stands directly over him and commands him to bark like a dog. Bark, boy, bark Howard insists. After a pause, Wake's meager woof marks what I believe to be the final stage of the shift in power dynamic between the two men. Whatsmore, after Wake's woofing, Howard asks him whose a good boy and to roll over in the same way a dog-owner would speak to their canine. What follows is an extreme, but powerful representation of just how drastically the power has shifted in Howard's favor. As he walks into the foreground, we see his is holding a rope lead on the end of which is Wake crawling on all fours like a dog. Here, Eggers makes no attempt at subtlety to convey the power Howard seems to wield in the two men's relationship. No longer is he the one being treated like a dog as if he is less than human. Now he is the one who holds the leash and dictates the other man, both literally and metaphorically. Notably, the raging tempest that dominates the film after Howard kills the gull seems to have completely dissipated. Pointing to the empty pit at the base of the lighthouse, he orders  Wake to get in there; where you belong. You do as I say, dog. Howard proceeds to shovel direct on top the old wickie. Now it was at this moment in the film that I expected Wake to break. I expected an increasingly tearful scene where Wake begs to be spared while Howard basks in the victory of literally burying the only obstacle that stands between him and the light. But as heaps of dirt are stacked onto his beaten body, Wake does not fuss nor cry. Instead, he is remarkably calm and seems to taunt Howard, asking his if he wishes to see what's in the lantern? before delivering one of the film's most memorable monologues in which he laments about what Protean forms swim up from men's mind and melt into hot Promethean plunder, scorching eyes and divine shames and horror and casting them down into Davy Jones. The others, still blind, yet in it see all the divine graces ... Them's truth. You'll be punished.  &#x200B;  I am wondering what you all think about the significance of dog name calling and references throughout the film? Is it used by Eggers to portray the rapid shift in the two men's power dynamic? What does it say about Thomas Howard's struggle to assert his identity? Based on Wake's calm demeanor and ominous monologue as Howard buries him, do you think there was a shift in power to begin with or does it just appear that way to Howard because he is the one who now holds the leash? Did Wake know that Howard was doomed from the beginning and will inevitably succumb to the fatal truth that awaits him atop the lighthouse? Does the light represent truth, which is why it kills Howard - a man averse to the truth?"

        "body": "Just some preamble. I'm an American, so maybe that's where most of my gripes come from. Although this movie is Icelandic, I believe, it's set in modern times, and although they live in the countryside, there is reason to believe, there is a metro/City area nearby so yeah. So I'm fully aware of any culture barriers, but I just dubunked them, so yeah. There are a few other posts on Reddit, discussing this movie, but not many. This post will contain spoilers, if you haven't seen it yet.  I first heard about Lamb, through one of those text to speech film recap channels on YouTube. (Which I hate, as they spoil the movie in the title, and spoil the movie in the recap video. Lol. They are also very viral, these types of videos. I can't stand it. Lol.) I had to stop watching the recap, to avoid being spoiled, and just add the film to my watchlist. The plot seemed interesting, as I like more morbid twisted psych thriller/horror stories. Etc. I finally rented it online this weekend. I was so disappointed, and I feel the film was very bad, and made no sense.  Assuming you all have seen the film, and know the plot. There are several avenues which list the sypnosis online. Because I'm just going to generalize, from this point forward. It's about a couple, Ingvar, and Maria, who have this large farm property in Iceland, where their home is adjacent to their farm business. One of their sheep, give birth to a half sheep, half human, hybrid offspring. They name her Ada, and raise her like a human child. Ingvar's brother Petur, later moves in with them.   First the good, and what I liked.  I loved the cinematography. I loved the location, their house, the farming business aesthetic. I loved how a lot of modern technology references were used (Petur shocked they still have VHS tapes in their living room). I liked the CGI they used for Ada. I liked how based on the production side of things, I felt I was at their farm/barn etc. So yeah.  Now onto what I didn't like.  I don't like how this is a movie, where you have to assume, and guess everything.  Ingvar and Maria, who are, Husband and Wife, farmers, help Ada's mother/the pregnant Lamb, we saw in the first scene staggering into the barn. However we see expressions of concerns on their faces, but we dont know what Ada's condition, or appearance is. We later find out, deep into the film, the lower portion of her body is human female, but the upper part, her head, arms, chest, are Lamb/sheep etc. Very confusing.  Ingvar and Maria immediately decide to adopt Ada as their daughter. (Which I understand they had a miscarriage earlier, but still) With no discussion of calling the news, no awkward phase. Both of them thinking a lamb/human hybrid is normal etc. Very perplexing.  Ada runs away several times. You think they would lock their front door, or put a leash on her. Hated how every other scene, Ingvar or Maria are in haste, as Ada ran out the house again.  Ingvar's brother Petur, is introduced, in a confusing way. You see a bunch of guys throw his wallet and phone into the wilderness, and kick him out the car. Is he in a secret mafia group? Is he a musician? Until Ingvar said Ada, this is Uncle Petur, I had suspicions he was his Brother, but we could only assume  All we know is Maria had an affair with him at one point. Feel this could have been better setup. Lol.  Maria kills Ada's mother, because she constantly pesters and follows, Ingvar and Maria, as she's depressed, they took her baby away, of course. Don't like how they wouldnt let her interact with Ada still. Etc.   Petur's reaction to Ada, is simply literally only, The fuck, and yet, he accepts Ada, and has a good relationship with her. He doesn't immediately run to the press, or city to reveal this secret? Yeah right.   Ada ages and grows up, at least a couple of years, by the time Petur moves in. So Ingvar and Maria's plan, was to always keep her hidden? Ada wears little girl human clothes. She has really good cognitive abilities. She can do chores around the house. She eats human food. She can watch TV, and dance. She is constantly cuddling either Ingvar, Maria, or Petur. She understands Icelandic. Etc. What about school for Ada. What about putting her on Iceland Got Talent etc. How long did they expect this secret gig to go on?  The really gross, uneeded, and out of place, sex scene between Ingvar and Maria, which was parallel edited to Petur and Ada downstairs in the living room, dancing and watching the music video channel on TV, was so cringe.   Petur tries to seduce Maria. She rejects his advances, and Peter just leaves in acceptance amicably. Keeping the Ada secret. Okay. Lol.   Climax ending scene. Igvar while out doing field work with Ada helping him, is shot and killed, by a half ram, half human like man, we assume is Ada's father. He also kills their dog for no reason. Smh. But I assumed it would have had to been a more human looking being, to be the father. The ram looked way too feral, and didnt have much humanoid features, unless he can shape shift, and we don't know. The ram drops the gun, and carries Ada away. Maria appears later, and is in total confusion. The end. No more explanations. Lol.  Feel this movie although cinema wise, was okay, just story wise. It wasn't that good. I feel maybe if this story were set in America, Ada would have been a reality star, and it would have been a different setup. Seems for no reason, the couple has no direction or plan for her. Petur/Uncle appears, and acts like Ada is a dog/cat, and doesn't feel creeped out, or intrigued. He's just whatever about it. Petur leaves on happy terms. Ada's assumed father is perturbed, and takes her away, killing Ingvar. Maria is just left with so many unanswered thoughts and questions. That's it. I don't know man. Smh. Lol.  Strange movie, but those are my gripes with it. Leave any comments please, if you guys agree/disagree. Thank you. :)"

So looking back over the Oscar award for Best Original Score I was pretty shocked that they both lost. Inception lost to The Social Network and Interstellar lost to The Grand Budapest Hotel. Both The Social Network and Grand Budapest have great soundtracks but they aren't as memorable.   Hans Zimmer felt like he was innovating with these two scores. Inception using a big orchestra of Brass players to emphasize the notion of time slowing down and making the score sound even more epic. Which went on to be copied A LOT. Then Interstellar utilizing a vast array of organ pipes and also incorporating the notion of a ticking clock into the soundtrack to subconsciously instill a sense of anxiety into the audience. Most of the score was so emotionally charged that it felt like it linked together Cooper and Murph, despite them being galaxies apart. Along with most of the tracks within these two scores being bangers. Like No Time for Caution or a random chase scene in Inception having the best chase music ever called Mombasa.  When you compare these two soundtracks to The Social Network and Grand Budapest it surprises me who ended up winning. Between the two though maybe Grand Budapest would have a chance, but still."

My aunt was the one watching, I really didn't want to as the little girl in it creeped me out, and she is the only real thing I remember from it.   – She wore a wig, and a mask. I believe she also wore a dress, with stockings, and dress shoes, but that part is vague at best.   – When it was revealed that she was burned, her father informed the 'guests' that it as punishment for being a bad girl.   – She never really spoke, but squealed when expressing her dissatisfaction.   – in the movie she appeared to be really sweet, but still gave the guests a weird vibe.   – she liked to sit on her dad's lap at the head of the table   Considering the info I remember, I can only assume it was a horror of some type, but as I stated before I was just a kid. It could have just seemed like a horror to me at the time. I don't remember the plot, a single other character, or actors/actresses that acted in it.  NOTE. It is not Les yeux sans visage (1960)."

        "body": "What big movie stars do you know of who mostly do bad or forgettable movies?  To kick this off, the one that comes to mind for me is Ryan Reynolds.  Now, don't get me wrong, I am not saying he does only bad or forgettable movies, but I am saying that he mostly does.  Obviously, we have his stand out hit/franchise Deadpool.  It seems that since Ryan Reynolds became a big star, his name was always attached to this character, and it was essentially handed to him on a plate, and he didn't disappointed.  He is perfect for the role.  The handling of the character was bad in his first outing (Wolverine), but since then it has been handled great.  He will forever be attached to Deadpool and that will keep him elevated as a big star and he'll likely never needs to work again if he so wishes.  But, most of his list of work just isn't great, with some minor exceptions.  Safe House was amazing.  It was very much in the same mould as the Jason Bourne action thrillers, but it worked on it's own.  More recently, Free Guy was a huge hit for Ryan Reynolds too.  I loved Buried, but many did not.  I am not too fond of the Hitman's Bodyguard myself, but I think audiences did respond well.  Despite these few exceptions, I just feel he is very bad at choosing roles.  Some of his films are very weird (not in a good way), and downbeat, and lifeless.  I don't know how else to explain them.    Another name that comes to mind is Chris Hemsworth.  Again, don't get me wrong, he of course has Thor behind him, as well as other related MCU movies (Thor to Hemsworth is much like Deadpool to Reynolds), but he has a long long list of utterly forgettable bad movies that just don't work in any way.  Again, with a few exceptions here and there, I feel he is very bad at choosing projects.  Do you agree with what I've said?  Do you have any other actors in mind who mostly do bad movies?  EDIT:  Related question:  what is the deal with Ryan Reynolds taking smaller roles in other people's movies?  The most recent example is in Hobbs and Shaw for all of two minutes.  Bullet Train.  Ted.  Life.  Criminal.  A Million Ways To Die In The West.  The list goes on."

        "body": "In the world of cinema, lighting is often an overlooked but essential element that can greatly enhance a film's visual aesthetic and help tell its story more effectively. One such example is the 1972 classic, The Godfather.  Directed by Francis Ford Coppola, The Godfather is a crime drama that follows the rise of the Corleone family, one of New York's most powerful mafia clans. The film is known for its complex characters, dramatic plot twists, and stunning visuals, and the lighting plays a key role in creating its mood and atmosphere.  One of the standout aspects of the lighting in The Godfather is its use of contrast. The film often features dark, shadowy scenes that create a sense of mystery and danger, while also highlighting the characters' emotions and inner turmoil. This is particularly evident in the famous scene where Michael Corleone (played by Al Pacino) kills a rival mafia boss in a dimly lit restaurant.  But the lighting in The Godfather is not just about creating a mood - it also helps to establish the film's setting and time period. The film is set in the 1940s and 1950s, and the lighting plays a crucial role in conveying this through its use of warm, golden tones and soft, diffused light. This gives the film a timeless, nostalgic quality that helps transport viewers to the world of the Corleone family.  Overall, the lighting in The Godfather is an integral part of the film's success. It adds depth and dimension to the story, and helps to create a rich, immersive experience for viewers. It's a prime example of how effective lighting can elevate a film from good to great."

The two persons in the room needed a clock for two reasons: one was to tell them when to drink water, and the other was to make sure they weren't dozing off. (Because, for a reason I can't recall, those in the room shouldn't be sleeping.) Additionally, the mirror I mentioned earlier is dangerous."

Every piece of foreground and background art and the themes and stories and characters have been thought about more then anyone should.  But overtime I've realized a few things. That Andy and Sid's fathers aren't present in the movie. In an interview Andy's dad has passed away is why he isn't there according to the writers. Sid's family seems more like his father and mother divorced or he was never there.   Why do I bring this up? Because I've decided that the movie is actually a comparison for how these two kids treat their toys and the people in their lives without a father figure to guide either of them. We see Sid being bad always, tortures toys, tortures his sister, and does whatever he wants. He was at Pizza Planet alone and road his skateboard him alone at night. Also he order a large firework rocket that explicitly says keep out of reach of children. Andy's mom brought him to Pizza Planet unlike Sid's mom. Then Sid asks his mom for matches and says never I got them and she never comes to see what he's burning or raises concern to stop him. This is showing how the nurture aspect has been so different for them. That Andy's mom is trying to make it okay for her son without the father there. And Sid's mom isn't really present, my assumption is from depression from her whole situation.  The reason why the story focuses on the toys instead mostly is because they were easier to animate at the time since everything looked like plastic so they decided to animate things that should be plastic. Then they just use the lives of the toys and how they feel about the kids to further build on the hidden underlying theme.  Have I seen this too many times? Yes. Please send help. If you'd like to discuss this more then let's see what you think. Have a great day with the kiddos everyone."

Despite the cringe romance of the film and the awkward editing here and there, the film was a massive financial success. It essentially launched the superhero movie genre into the stratosphere. It doesn't change the fact that someone that average has been able to be that successful. She must have an amazing agent."

They really use it to their advantage, kinda like Collateral.  Solid performances too. RDJ is firmly in Tony Stark mode here and seeing him do that in a different kind of movie was fun. And this might actually be my favorite Val Kilmer performance. His acerbic delivery is spot on but I actually kinda bought him as a detective too. I thought Michelle Monaghan overcooked it a few times with the drama and overacting, but not by much, and it does kind of work for the tone they're going for.  I will say, I did really like the narration, and it's necessary to complete the homage to 50s noir he's doing here, but I think Shane Black uses it as a crutch a couple times.   There's a few moments where Harry acknowledges that something is a plothole or a cliché, and that meta acknowledgment through narration is meant to hand wave any issues. It was funny, but it did also feel like a bit of a cheap way to quickly write yourself out of any corner.  But yeah, overall it's funny, the story's interesting, and even though it's not an action movie, the few scenes of it that are there are well-filmed. Particularly the climax on the bridge I thought was quite cool."

Aslan and Tilda Swinton are on the poster/cover, but their *collective* screentime in the movie add up to barely 5 minutes.

There's a little girl they want us to try care about and feel happy for near the end, except she's had two scenes and about a minute of screentime.  All in all, this was a snoozefest."

I'm thinking of Drive, Taxi Driver, Blade Runner 2049, Good Time, etc etc. Guys generally relate to them because they're an outlet for emotions that they feel society rarely allows them to express.     I know I'm not making any major discoveries here, this genre is mostly an internet phenomenon and these types of films have existed way back since the 30s/40s with the advent of the noir, but that thought just made me hold some newfound appreciation for a series of films that have almost just become a meme whenever they're brought up at this point."

With the fact that there were massive names on board and such small time to make a mark, he did it with superb style. Honorable mentions go to Donald Sutherland in JFK, he had one exposition dump and did it with astonishing style. In a film that had Gary Oldman, Tommy Lee Jones, Joe Pesci and Jack Lemmon as supporting characters, his one scene taking the entire show away is amazing. Also Abigail Breslin in Little Miss Sunshine, she was 10 and gave a perfomance stronger than everyone in that ensemble, that is insane. What are your choices? Let me know."

So now I see rise of the beasts is coming out, see the trailer that shows Optimus as his original truck form (bumblebee is still a retro camaro, meh) but then I see a porsche and think “Wow is this a reboot? Maybe a chance to stick more faithfully to the characters and mythology?” But no, the porsche isn't actually Jazz, but this is mirage. Like WTF?! Couldn't get Jazz right in the first movie and just kill him off anyway now you just keep screwing with what vehicles etc they were.

Thought he was also good in the neighbors movies and Mike and Dave need wedding dates  I actually think he should've gotten some award recognition so far.

        "body": "As a discerning cinephile, I must confess that I find the revered status of The Godfather trilogy to be entirely unwarranted. While it is undoubtedly a well-crafted and expertly acted series of films, its lauded place in the pantheon of cinematic history is, in my opinion, nothing more than a product of hype and nostalgia.  Firstly, the story itself is rather trite and unoriginal. The narrative arc of a young man's rise to power within a crime syndicate has been explored countless times before, and The Godfather offers little in the way of innovation or fresh perspective on the subject. The overly macho and chauvinistic portrayal of its male characters is rather tiresome, and the frequent scenes of gratuitous violence quickly become repetitive and tedious.  Additionally, the cinematography and direction are somewhat unremarkable. While there are certainly some striking visual moments, the overall aesthetic is rather predictable and derivative, failing to push the boundaries of the medium in any meaningful way. Furthermore, the overreliance on close-ups and dialogue-heavy scenes detracts from the visual appeal of the films, making them feel more like stage plays than truly cinematic experiences.  While I do not deny the technical proficiency and acting prowess on display in The Godfather trilogy, I cannot help but feel that its vaunted reputation is greatly exaggerated. It is a competent, if uninspired, crime drama that does little to justify its place among the greatest films of all time.  One of the key factors contributing to the overhyped nature of The Godfather trilogy is its thematic reliance on well-trodden mobster tropes. The narrative of The Godfather is essentially a retelling of the rise and fall of a powerful mafia family, a story that has been told countless times before and since. While Coppola's treatment of this familiar material is undoubtedly skillful, it is not particularly innovative or groundbreaking. Moreover, the film's portrayal of Italian-American culture is reductive and stereotypical, reinforcing negative stereotypes rather than offering a nuanced and complex depiction of the community. The Godfather's depiction of violence and the criminal underworld is deeply problematic. The violence in these films is presented as almost glamorous, with the mafia members depicted as charismatic, intelligent and ultimately justifiable in their actions. This romanticization of organized crime is both disturbing and irresponsible, and does not merit the widespread acclaim that these films have received. The violence in The Godfather is often gratuitous and excessively graphic, which only serves to further glorify.   In conclusion, while I do not deny the technical proficiency and acting prowess on display in The Godfather trilogy, I cannot help but feel that its vaunted reputation is greatly exaggerated. It is a competent, if uninspired, crime drama that does little to justify its place among the greatest films of all time.  TL;DR: The Godfather trilogy is overhyped and overrated because its story is trite and unoriginal, its portrayal of violence is gratuitous and irresponsible, and its direction and cinematography are unremarkable."

My personal favorite is in Netflix's The Week Of when Sandler's character cluelessly invites two random black guys walking by the street outside his house to the family pre-wedding breakfast thinking they are relatives of the black groom. Something about the Office-esque way it's played straight as just a very awkward misunderstanding makes me laugh out loud every time I watch the scene.

It's basically when, in the credits of a movie, a production company or studio is listed more than once.  To give some examples, at the beginning of Godzilla vs. Kong (as well as the other monster verse movies) and Denis Villeneuve's “Dune” the credits read as followed:  “Warner Bros. Pictures and Legendary Pictures present - a Legendary Pictures production”  Other companies I've noticed that do this quite a bit are Lionsgate, Skydance, and Black Label Media.  It annoys the absolute hell out of me. So many movies nowadays have a hundred different studios to credit. Why do companies feel that they need to be listed twice?  Also it just looks stupid in my opinion, especially when the credits literally read like “Lionsgate presents a Lionsgate production”  I don't know. It really shouldn't be that big of a deal but it really irritates me for some reason. Does anyone know why so many companies do this?"

I guess you have to write 300 words before this can be posted so here's my review of the franchise as a whole... like anybody cares.  I overall enjoyed all the films that came out in this franchise, but will admit they had their share of problems. For me, it was mostly the fifth movie I didn't care for. And also Ian McShane was underutilized. Even though I liked Blackbeard, I guess the standout character in the series for me was Geoffrey Rush's Captain Barbosa. Everytime he was on screen it looked like he was having the time of his life. And the CGI, come on, the movies are almost 20 years old and they still hold up.

In the movie there is a lot of talk about the insanity defense only being possible before the start of the trial.  That seems really unfair. When, over the course of the trial something comes to light that makes you realize your client may be criminally insane and not liable for his actions, this making it necessary to change the defense to insanity. But then, this not being possible because you should have done so before the trial even started.  I really don't understand how this could be the law. I mean, maybe the movie got it wrong as they often do.  Maybe someone is knowledgeable enough in US law to clear this up. I am from Germany and so only know about US law from novels and movies :)"

Most of them aren't funny but still!

I've been using streaming, which I assume is the same as a DVD or BluRay in terms of being a digital copy. So are they editing these out?  Follow up question: does anyone still use the cigarette burn to synchronize reels of film anymore? I know when I was a teen in ~2001 we would unwind all the reels onto this one, huge wheel before the digital era.

I'm looking for movies where the main character(s) will eventually wake up or whatever come to or even discover such a place after an apocalypse or an accident or something like that! The main thing is that they don't know what happened at the beginning. The best would be a movie where the characters might even have to live in a bunker and learn more and more about what happened over time. It doesn't always have to be action, the main thing is that the story is interesting or mysterious. Supernatural is fine, but not a must. Supernatural, horror, spooky is all fine, but the focus should be on the story about the location of the building/bunker/mall. It's also okay if other people are found/met in the course of the film."

The only thing is the fight scenes are pretty lame by today's standards, but if you can appreciate the camp quality they are still enjoyable. Some of dialogue is awesome too, so classic! I also have discovered some very easy on the eyes Femme Fatalles like Merry Anders and Mari Blanchard, who has a sex appeal on par with Marilyn Monroe, too bad she never made it out of the B list, she looks like she is part of a different time, stunning!"

You add the movies and the TV shows you want and it will generate a list with all their tracks. It doesn't have to be IMDB specific or provide links to the songs (even though it would help a lot). I know that you can find websites that do that sort of thing for individual movies or episodes however we are talking about thousands of movies and hundreds of TV shows, some of which have over one hundred episodes.

I actually loved Fear and Desire despite many people hating it (and Kubrick himself). I actually think Killer's Kiss is his weakest film, but even that film has some really great shots in it.  I want to do a Hitchcock marathon next…I love Psycho, it's one of my favorite movies of all time. I watched Rear Window years ago, I remember loving it. Haven't seen anything else by him. I actually think the 50s was a great decade for film. Obviously, I'm no stranger to “old movies” and I definitely don't get put off by black and white…in fact, I kind of prefer it in some ways. It gives movies that vintage feel that can kinda be unsettling sometimes and I really like the look of them.  But yeah, I'm actually a little nervous to go even further back to like the 30s. I know Hitchcock started in 1922, but that's just way too old. I put on The Pleasure Garden for like 2 minutes and couldn't do it, even for appreciation's sake. I can't watch a silent film.  So I'm wondering, how far back should I start with Hitchcock's films? From what I can see, it looks like The 39 Steps is his first popular film, but if you guys think I should go back further than that, let me know. He has over 50 movies anyway, so I'd like to cut out the fat. Once I hit the 40s, I should be good to go, but where do you guys think I should start?  And I guess I'll just ask…is it worth pushing through his silent films? If it's worth it from a film perspective I'll do it, but idk man. I love film, but I can't do the silent stuff. I was thinking about starting from Blackmail, his first film with sound, but I noticed that there's still a lot of stuff between that and The 39 Steps, and these are all films I've never even heard of. It's not like Kubrick where he has only a couple of unknown films before he started making classics. Hitchcock has like 20 lol."

        "body": "Went out and saw The Menu and have a lot of complicated feelings about it. My most complicated feeling though, revolves around Tyler and the way he's both treated in the film and by the audience. I want to be really, *really* clear that this is not some incel-simp post, hand waving his actions away. What it is, is a shift in the perspective of events and a discussion on whether we think this was clever filmmaking or unintentional narrative.  While asking the internet not to be mean is a little like putting a Don't let your dog poop in my yard sign up: *These takes are after an initial watch so, there may be bits I missed or don't remember. I already plan to watch it again once it releases on streaming so, I will be giving this another shake.*  &#x200B;  **1.** **He knew everyone was going to die and brought her anyway.**  I have an incredibly hard time with this plot point for a few reasons and want to get it out of the way quickly, because it's not a factor in this discussion.   First and foremost:    *Who would take an email seriously from an internationally famous chef that says Come pay me an exorbitant amount of money to eat on my island. PS: I'm going to kill everyone there.?*   It just makes no sense. I get the idea, he literally tells people what he's going to do and it seems so outlandish they don't believe him. It's like telling your boss you're going to drive your car through a wall next time he walks by your desk and then getting upset at him when he gets upset at you for doing exactly that. I literally told you I'd do this, you cite as he calls the police. It's such an irrational claim that nobody would take it seriously.  Secondly:  *We have no evidence that everyone else there either did or didn't get the same message.*  The movie demonizes Tyler for bringing Margo because he knew she would die, and his excuse is  that the chef doesn't do tables for one. So, theoretically, he knew he was killing this innocent person, but didn't care because he wanted this experience. Even if you throw away my above issue that this knowledge is simply so outrageous that no one would take it seriously, we still don't have enough evidence to damn Tyler specifically here. How do we know everyone else in the room didn't do the same thing? Did tell me I'm a good dad man get this email invitation and bring his wife along anyway? Did she do that to him maybe? Did they both get it and both choose to ignore it? Did snobby food critic woman see it and laugh then invite her simp editor or whoever he was?   We simply don't have enough evidence that nobody else knew this information. If Tyler was the only one who knew, *maybe* we can dislike him for that. Even then, see point one. However, we don't know that everyone didn't have the same info or that they didn't do the same thing... So why do we focus on Tyler?  &#x200B;  **2. Tyler is both paying for Margot to be there, and paying her to be there.**  Margo \\[Erin\\] is an escort. People pay her for her time so that they can force their experiences on her. Now, I'm not here to talk about the morality of the trade in general or even the trade at all really; only the expectations that I think are fair given the situation.   Consider this: You plan a trip for you and a friend to Disneyland -- you make the arrangements, you drive, and you even pay for their room, admission, and \\[not to be too on the nose\\] food. Not only that, but you are a diehard Disney fan and this is the first time you've ever been. It's kind of a big deal for you. They... don't share your excitement quite so much, but they're happy to support you since you *are* paying, after all. Now, once you get there \\[remember, all expenses paid trip\\] they decide that they don't want to go to the park. They want to stay in the room and play their Switch that they brought with them. Not only that, but they talk shit on Disney the whole time and are generally kind of a downer.  Now, this is a *friend* we're talking about here. Someone you know and probably deeply care about. You'd almost certainly have a talk with them or get very irritated at their behavior. Imagine that situation with someone you don't even know, who's self-proclaimed job is for you to pay them and then they go along with whatever experience you're after, as long as it's within the boundaries they've set.   We know that he's paid her ticket price, because the movie literally tells us. We can assume that he's *also* paying her time price, because that is how she makes money. Her time is valuable, and she charges directly for it. Considering these three things \\[ticket, time, respecting service boundaries\\]; I think it's very strange that we're supposed to dislike Tyler for being upset that she's not only not participating, but *actively* not participating by having a snobby-to-openly-shitty attitude about it the *entire* time.  Yes, what he says is rude. Yes, he could let her be unhappy and not let that effect his experience. Yes... that's also kind of an idealistic outlook on human behavior... Especially when one is meeting their god-idol for the first time.  Again, I'm not excusing him of responsibility or saying it's cool to lash out at people. I just want to examine whether or not we're giving him a fair shake as a character, given the exact situation.  &#x200B;  **3. Why does the chef embarrass him in front of everyone?**  This was a scene that was a little strange to me as I was watching it, and has gotten more strange the longer I think about it. \\[Again, I could just be forgetting but...\\] Tyler never claimed to be a chef. He never claimed to have any kind of cooking skills at all. Sure, he makes some pompous-know-it-all statements, but I don't remember him claiming he could do better. Tyler is, essentially, just a Brony for chef Slowik and the art of cooking at large. I don't remember him *criticizing* the food even one time. Instead, he does everything he can to enjoy as much of it as he can, even going so far as to ignore the potential consequences of the life or death hide-and-seek game and insist on stuffing his face with what the others got. Tyler almost certainly has a Slowik body pillow at home that he holds at night. Great! So, what does he get for this adoration, this idol worship? Shamed. Shamed literally to death.   And for what? Being pompous? Isn't it possible... Isn't it a *little more than possible* that he was so nervous, so anxious, to meet his idol that he was not being intentionally cruddy? Haven't we all had moments of peacocking that make us literally cringe when we look back on them? Is that a death sentence?   This scene is a fairly large moment in the film for me, because it's one that either makes this a very clever satire or breaks it as something very basic and boring. Based on my interpretation of this scene, we either have an incredibly shallowly written character that is simply designed for us to dislike, or we have a tremendously brilliant piece of self-reflection that isn't designed to hit you until after the film is over.  &#x200B;  **4. I hope my interpretation of Tyler stands up to a second watch.**  It's easy to pan Tyler off as the shitty boyfriend character that we get to see our heroine break free from like in the theatrical \\[but not so much the director's\\] cut of 2019's Midsommar. But, what if he's not? What if, akin to 2017's Super Dark Times, there's a little more going on with this character than we're initially presented with?  Let's shift gears for a minute and talk about The Hunchback of Notre Dame and my favorite discussion around the Quasi doesn't get the girl issue. I can't find the source of it at the moment, but it basically boils down to Quasi and Frollo both see Esmerelda as something to idolize. Quasi to worship and please, Frollo to possess and use but, sides of the same coin. Neither see her for what she is: A human being. Phoebus, on the other hand, does see that in her. Sure he wants to absolutely slam, but he doesn't worship her and he doesn't want to *own* her. She, like him, is more complicated than people think, and he truly appreciates her humanity. She gets this, and so chooses the person who will facilitate her growth rather than nice-guy-Quasi or rape-guy-Frollo.  I *want* to interpret Tyler in a similar fashion. \\[I say want because I'm not sure this was the intent of the film.\\]  Starting even at the very beginning of the movie, Tyler is hero-worshipping Slowik. He scoffs at the corporate-bros as they walk and chatter down the steps, and he fawns over every single detail along the tour. One of the first things they're told is not to take pictures of anything, because the purpose of art is to be ephemeral. You are supposed to remember your experience with it, and thus, through that memory, you create the legacy of the piece. In a sense, *you* become the truth of the art you perceive. Tyler... Literally cannot help himself and immediately takes pictures of his food. Despite being told *by the artist* what the intent of the gallery is, Tyler is so obsessed that he *needs* to hang on to this memory for all time. \\[This, by the way, also justifies my point that he, nor anybody else, took the you're going to die threat seriously. Why would you take pictures of something if you're just going to die later?\\]  Tyler's photography is apparently *so egregious* that when others are given tortillas showing infidelity and financial fraud, Tyler receives images of... *SOON-TO-BE INSTAGRAM POSTS 😱😱😱.* In the micro, this is very silly. If we zoom out a little and consider the Hunchback analogy again though, I think there is something that can be said about it.  Tyler is sat behind the food critic. Her job is to critique restaurants and hold them to an impossible standard of perfection. Her words \\[as exemplified by the ever growing bowls of split emulsion\\] grow as they wind their way through her audience. A once split emulsion will become purported fingers in chili and hairs on plates by the end of the week as more and more play the game of criticism telephone. While, ostensibly, both her and Tyler share the same love of the craft, they personify this in very different ways. He, like Quasi, worships Slowik and others like him. They can do no wrong, they are perfect and should be adored, not criticized. She, like Frollo \\[well... sort of like Frollo. She doesn't want to cleanse Slowik's soul ;))))... or does she?\\], seeks that same perfection but she holds the world to an impossible standard and looks down on everyone because of it. Both are equally damming of the art because, both miss the point while insisting they see it better than anyone else.   In *worshipping* cooking and the people behind it, you're not seeing their creations for what they are. You're not internalizing what the pieces mean for you and you're not truly experiencing them because you already know it's either going to be perfect or you're looking for the right nick in the armor to poke at. Treating something like a god does not allow room for growth, and so deprives the artist of meaningful critique, interpretation, or legacy. In condemning art because of exactly that worship, you do the same thing. By seeing this Elysium of concept and holding all to that standard, you create a pretense that nothing will be good enough. And, thus, you also don't appreciate the art because you are only looking for the flaws.   So, what does this have to do with Tyler being embarrassed in front of the entire cast?   Everything.  Abstract Tyler from the context of this film for a moment. What is he? He's someone who is incredibly passionate about a subject he has very little or no experience performing. He's someone meeting their most precious hero for the first \\[and at $1,250, probably only\\] time. He's someone who wants to be seen. His presentation of his enthusiasm is a little immature, sure. But, that enthusiasm and passion is certainly not worth ridiculing on its own.  So... In this abstract form, who is Tyler?   Tyler is the person who watches hundreds of hours of YouTube on woodworking techniques and how to identify species of lumber, but doesn't even own a drill. He's the person who's very favorite thing is movies and he critiques and praises them almost without end, much the chagrin of his peers, but he couldn't work a camera to save his life. He's the cosplayer who's own costumes are nothing but plans and dreams, but could tell you the name of every stich, material, and technique used by the pros. Why are these people like this? Know-it-alls from around the web, nerds of various shapes and castes, the person who always has something to say about your favorite thing. Why do these people with such heavy handed opinions not just shut up and *become* the people they admire? Maybe it's because of financial reasons, maybe health barriers keep them from pursuing their craft, maybe they have more experience than this but they still aren't the pros they seem like to their less impassioned friends. Maybe... It's ok to just like something and enjoy speaking on it without trying to be the next David Blane.  In a word, Tyler is -- they are -- an amateur. And there is nothing the world likes to hate, quite like an amateur.  The whole film is about society's degradation of the value of art. Be it food, paintings, music, writing; any of it. Society doesn't care about it if they can't use it, consume it, or sell it. I have a lot of art in my house and one of the first questions I get asked when someone new comes over is, How much did that cost?. Rarely is the initial reaction a reflection of how the piece makes them feel or a question of who the artist is or the medium used. It's almost always directly related to the cost. Think about any time you have a meal with friends, family, partners. People ask what you got, then they ask what the bill was like. So, being that this is the purpose of the entire film -- the visual satirization of this dilemma -- I like to interpret Tyler's whole role as that of the amateur.  The person who loves a subject but cannot perform it in such a manner as to wow an audience or support themselves. Someone who's reach of knowledge exceeds their grasp of practice. Some are more elegant than others when displaying this passion -- with Tyler being on the more inelegant side of the spectrum -- but, what we see in the scene when he is shamed, is the very real personification of both Imposter Syndrome and general anxiety around putting yourself out there in the world.  Imagine that you love to write. Pressured by the constant nag of society to monetize your skills, you put yourself out there... and get destroyed. People hate it. They call it juvenile, pointless, stupid, boring, jejune, and derivative. You post it on multiple forums and the only feedback you get back, is that you can't do this. For all the studying you've done, all the books you've read, and all the passion you have; all the world can do is laugh at you. Over and over and over you're told that you can! You can be anything you want, *do* anything you want. But, when you take that first step out of their box, they laugh you right back into it. You're not ready, you're not good enough. And because you're not good enough now -- because that book does work in its current form, your game doesn't play smoothly as you have it right now, that chair you made doesn't sit flat with your skills as they are -- you'll *never* be good enough.   You, are an amateur.   I like to interpret Tyler's role in the film as that of an allegory to being an amateur in the real world. It exemplifies the way that mediocre work is demonized by society at large, made worthless through lack of attention, and deemed completely unprofitable and hopeless by those who are already succeeding. Decent, isn't good enough. Good, is forgettable... Perfect, is the standard. And if you can't produce to that degree *right now*, you might as well just hang yourself with your tie in the chef's office, because that's as close as you'll ever get to sitting in his chair.  Is this the intent behind Tyler's character? I don't know, I don't really think so. But I like to hope so. I like to hope so because it ends up being an excellent piece of self reflective storytelling where we, as the audience, totally side with Margo in the moment. But, if we stop and really consider who Tyler was -- an excited, anxious, passionate little boy at heart -- we kind of realize how shitty we are in jeering at his failure. He's not completely redeemable, of course, and I've already said multiple times that he *is* still wholly responsible for his actions. I just think that, in the context of everything else, maybe the film has led us to view him in a light we should consider a little more deeply in a real-world perspective."

Meryl Streep and Daniel Day Lewis are extremely similar as far as career arcs go: constant endless recognition for being one of the greatest actors in history all throughout their life from earliest works to old age, only marred sliiiightly perhaps by the fact that for most of their careers the actual movies they were in were always just 'ok to great' rather than like 'contender for greatest film ever'. Certainly under-seen considering their own contributions.    This distinguished them from most of their contemporaries-there's a hilarious Onion fake op Ed where 'Meryl' breaks this down comparing herself to other actors like Diane Keaton or Al Pacino and concludes that people should think of her as like, 'great actor, mediocre movies'.    This was true of DDL too until There Will be Blood in my opinion. None of his other movies come even close to it (even Phantom Thread which of course IS the second best of his but still..quite a far cry from TWBB as far as ultimate history of the art form goes I'd say).    I really think PTA and Meryl would each benefit from a partnership with her in a lead role in at least one film. I think it would be amazing for both of their legacies. And yea, I kinda DO think they probably think about stuff in these terms based on my impression of them."

The latest poll has it at **#1** for Directors and **#5** for critics   Jeanne Dielman, 23 quai du Commerce, 1080 Bruxelles is a french film about a mom that does chores in her apartment for roughly 3 and a half hours. No, I'm serious. That's sorta it. The title basically translates to the woman's name and her address which is fitting because that's what the movie is all about. It's very light on dialogue with the film mostly comprised of long shots of a single mom tidying up and prepping meals for her teenage son. She does venture out to grab groceries and check the mail ever so often. But the bulk is just her peeling potatoes, making coffee, making the bed and stuff   It sounds awful. But it's easily one of the best movies I've seen. I'll admit it does drag at times. But that's sort of by design. You really connect with her character. It's sorta hypnotic in a way. It's not going to be everyone's cup. But I definitely recommend it. It changed how I look at movies. A movie can be long, slow, and for the most part completely uneventful and still be totally riveting. Check it out."

I was always attracted to something that was different from commercial movies...so when i started watching critically acclaimed and arthouse movies when i was 16... it was exciting enough to watch something I've never seen before and get disgusted,confused,blown away by it...but now it just doesn't feel the same... Honestly the kind of films that do resonate me or that i do like are movies like scent of a woman,Dead poets society,Good will hunting and movies like pulp fiction,kill Bill mainly because i guess these movies have a pretty simple story and maybe heavily stylised and might have some Easter eggs here and there but nothing major groundbreaking mainly these movies connect with me... I'm not trying to force or anything but i really wanna get into arthouse movies and want to understand films like a clockwork Orange,Mulholland drive etc(I've seen both of them ) without some reviewers or anything...

I guess what I mean is: We're living a different time due to the internet, we can access anything from any time, which makes it easier for old things to be fresh in our memories and even so in the public's knowledge, since once you turn Gene Wilder's Willy Wonka into a meme, young people from nowadays will know the Chocolate Factory, sort of.  So what I'm saying is... movies don't have to stand out so they can be known for the years to come anymore, they don't have to be the most famous so they can be everlasting, because everything is.  I try to think of the movies from the 21st Century that could become classic 20 years from now, and... all of them are... forgetful? I don't know, definitely NOT because they're bad, but because they're celebrated for a while and then they join the piles of content on the internet. They're still being debated here and there, but by small niches.  There's only a few movies I can believe will be eternalized even outside the whole thing. The first one of them is actually a franchise, the MCU thing... although NOT the most perfect filmmaking product, feels like something that'll survive the test of time. It's popular enough now for me to feel safe to say it'll last for a long time.  Also... John Wick. Again, it's not perfect, but it has its own identity, it's getting more and more popular even outside the internet. It might not be the best action movie from the last 20 years, but I feel like it's gonna be the BIGGEST years from now.  What do you guys thinks about that? Is it a crazy thought? What are the movie that WILL become classic, in your opinion?"

True, Silence of the Lambs accomplishes both of these feelings but so do many other movies I never see considered horror.  Se7en is a prime example. I've never seen that mentioned as a horror film even though I think the horror elements are much more utilized in that than in Silence of the Lambs. What do you all think?

But four years before came a more tightly focused movie, a greek tragedy featuring people bringing on their own demise. It's basically a chamber play in the vein of David Mamet-- it's spare and selfish with its context clues. The performances straddle line between hammy and brilliant. Jeremy Iron's monologue is on the same level as Alec Baldwin's at the start of Glengarry Glen Ross. It recalls Gordon Gekko's praise of greed and I can't describe the delivery as anything other than juicy. Literally, Irons is savoring every word when he says, So that we may survive.  They talk about the market, but you don't really need to know the specifics of what it is they're trading to understand the disaster, like you do with The Big Short. It could be mortgage derivatives, it could be orange futures, doesn't matter, so if you're only kind of interested in the crypto element, but want more about the drama around the collapse, this pick is for you.

But as I was going through his filmography, I noticed something strange about a stretch of his films between 1990 and 1994: Almost all these movies involved an and actor of Italian decent getting violently destroyed by a small child and/or dog!     - **Movie:** *Home Alone 1 & 2*; **Victim:** Joe Pesci, Italian decent; **Crimes:** Violent use of household items, by a minor, to cause third degree burns, head trauma, and dental damage on two separate occasions.     - **Movie:** *Beethoven*; **Victim:** Stanley Tucci, Italian decent; **Crimes:** Viciously attacked by an array of K9s. Causing him to scream like a girl.   - **Movie:** *Beethoven's 2nd*; **Victim(s):** Chris Penn, Debi Mazar, Italian Decent; **Crimes:** Use of mother nature to ruin their clothes and causes Penn's head to land in a stump with more precious than Tiger Woods.    - **Movie:** *Baby's Day Out*; **Victim(s):** Joe Mantegna AND Joe Pantoliano, Italian decent (he was feeling rather violent this screenplay); **Crimes:** Infant Neglect that results in dangerous construction accidents and...um...something with a gorilla sexually assaulting them? (I don't remember and neither do you, so go with it.)    All these movies...all these innocent actors whose characters were put through the most painful tortures you could physically put a human being through. We're their characters bad? Yes, but were any of their crimes deserving of skull fractures, brain trauma, and possible rabies/gorilla STDs? Well...let me answer you by saying this: Martin Scorsese is one of the most brutal filmmaker's who puts his characters through hell (mostly of Italian decent) and even he wouldn't imagine the cruelty of smashing a paint can across a crime bosses face at high velocity.     What did they do to John Hughes? How did the Italian community hurt him in the late 80's to delve into such a harsh punishment of those that come from a culture of fine cuisines, beautiful music and art, and Parmesan cheese? Does any of this matter? Am I wasting my time trying to connect the dots to his anger towards the Godfather series?

        "body": "Warning: Everything in this review is coming from an appreciator of David Bowie, but not a die-hard fan.  This film is a puzzle piece of psychedelic visuals, Bowie's inner emotion, and the fact he was an influential adventurer that always valued natural change in the world.  I love the fact that the director, Brett Morgen, didn't have a narration guiding the audience into Bowie's journey. It was ALL BOWIE, no one else to tell his story except for his own voice. That's an element that makes this documentary different from every other one out there, and why it's one of the best-made documentaries I've ever seen.  My favorite aspect of this was the fact that Bowie detailed his family who had a long line of mental illness, and how he didn't have a very eventful childhood. These are the moments that made him who he was, simply because he wanted to change his appearance constantly out of the fear of never experiencing or exploring new identities or feelings of life. It sounds super hippyish, but seriously, it's super fascinating and insightful.  I love the intercutting of classic '50s and '70s cinema with cyberpunk and old-school sci-fi imagery while painting a picture of Bowie's years of work. It showcases his style perfectly while not feeding the audience a typical narrative. Much of the imagery also is of art and films Bowie made himself, which made me learn a lot. The editing and sound design is perfect here, and it's the true defining element of this trippy experience. The use of color grading is also incredible.  My only tiny gripes with this is that the pacing in the first twenty minutes is fast and energetic, but it surprisingly slows down to showcase Bowie's newer state of mind. The slower section is easily where the documentary really shines, making the faster stuff not as memorable. Also, the ending is a bit too abrupt for me.  Overall, it's definitely worth taking a look if you want to know more insight on a legend that's enigmatic, and there's a lot to love, including hearing Bowie's music."

        "body": "As a huge fan of the first film, which I thought was an underrated and super well-done thriller with fun and well-developed characters, I was looking forward to finally seeing this and was crossing my fingers in hoping this would be decent at least…  …and 'decent' it was.  Adam Robitel clearly wants to make a bigger world and narrative for this Escape Room franchise, and with the concept of having the new set of supporting characters be previous winners is awesome. However, he also tries to create a subplot regarding the game master and everything with that was super whatever, in my opinion. Also, the version I watched was the supposed 'extended cut' which added that subplot into it, so I watched the missing scenes from the theatrical cut, and I feel the extended cut made a little bit more sense thematically rather than the theatrical cut feeling like its overusing reveals and shock value.  Taylor Russell is solid here as Zoey, but Logan Miller does an incredible job once again as the character, Ben, who honestly might be one of my favorite horror/thriller characters of all time. He's super charming and funny while also having very realistic reactions and decision-making throughout the film. The rest of the supporting characters are acted very well but my personal standouts are Thomas Cocquerel as Nathan and Indya Moore as Brianna, both of them gave the best performances in my opinion. Isabelle Fuhrman was decent, but her material was not really that interesting to me.  The production and puzzle design for the new rooms are super wacky and creative, they definitely are an upgrade from the first film, personally. My favorites were probably the beach room and the city street room, they were extremely beautiful-looking and the different steps were super awesome. The tone of the film is a bit different from the glommy and grim tone of the first film as it becomes an '80s colorful cyberpunk-ish thriller, in a way that I really dug. The score is also very cyberpunk-y which I also loved, but that dubstep song at the end is laughably bad, and I love EDM. The humor was actually quite good, and the character development is solid, in which I actually felt really bad when characters died off.  My main issues though is that the 'game master' subplot is very bland and occupies the first and final act of this film. The second act is actually pretty incredible, but it being bookended by a cheesy twist in the end left a sour taste, in my opinion. Some of the green screen in the first act looked atrocious, and I didn't care much for the intro to this film. There are certain lines in the writing that were trying to be dramatic that were absolutely cringeworthy. There's literally a line that someone says that goes;  “What's this supposed to be?! A Tournament Of Champions?” Like, did they just Suicide Squad this film, come on?!  But overall, this turned out alright, and if Robitel wants to make a third one, I'll be there in no time."

For example, both characters butting heads over the title of the mockumentary or the redacted lines from the book they find. There's a ton of red herrings, breaking forth wall, mixed media shots that make it clear that this isn't your typical movie. That being said, some things point toward an objective storyline. For example, while we don't exactly know the cause of the gravity phenomenon. We do know that its responsible for Levi's death. What I don't understand is the end credit scene showing an orchestra humming the words to a song while holding a russian nest doll. This happens after the final scene showing the wind chimes. What is the significance of this? Is it just an extra scene that was cut from the movie or is somehow connected to the gravity phenomenon."

Who thought it was a good idea to make the entire race of white people seem like evil bastards as if this is 1845? Every one they've encountered is horribly racist, really? In reality it would've been more likely for them to be helped than harassed. Obviously racism still exists but not so widespread or blatantly to the point a black family couldn't go on a road trip without encountering a single decent white person. That's just not reality.   And the woke BS dialogue has me just about rolling my eyes out of my head.  Queen Latifah: “We're not criminals!” (Well…your brother literally is considering he just stole a bag of drug money from a murder scene).  Ludicris: “We're the next best thing…we're black.” Oh, how very 2022. Yawn.   I am extremely disappointed. This is not the first movie I've watched like this. Do directors not realize how awful and divisive it is to make movies with a black main cast that white people can't watch without being made to feel like dog shit? It legitimately feels like I selected something I shouldn't have because this movie is not for me, it's for the oppressed black population."

There were still some movies that he had done that I still have not seen like Ali   What he did was wrong and he's coming out and admitting that still to this day. People make mistakes yes but for me, I'm still not sure when I will go back to watching his movies.

        "body": "hello everyone, this is my first review!  i recently watched the 2013 movie Bad Words, directed by and starring Jason Bateman. i tend to like bateman's acting, and i like his voice a lot. plus allison janney was in it, and she did a great job.  the movie plot was interesting at first, i'll admit: a forty-something year old adult man enters a spelling competition by abusing a loophole, and he won't say why he's doing what he's doing. alright, that's a pretty unique plot.  although i have qualms with the plot itself, i want to bring up what bothered—and continues to bother—me about this movie.  bateman's character, guy trillby, is the typical sarcastic, smartass jerk who treats anybody and everybody poorly—including kids, of course. early on in the movie, guy meets a young indian boy named chaitanya chopra, and it's established early on that this boy is very smart yet gets bullied in school (of course), and has a sucky dad.  guy is, obviously, uninterested and annoyed with chaitanya's attempts at conversation. at least, he is until he arrives at the hotel and is assigned to sleep in the utility closet. chaitanya tells guy that he has a whole hotel room to himself, and guy discovers that the room includes a mini bar. this prompts guy to start hanging out with chaitanya.  now, a complete stranger of a 40-something year old man hanging out with a 10 year old boy is creepy enough. but the stuff that guy teaches chaitanya about is disturbing, and only adds to the uncomfortableness.  foul language (not that severe, compared to the rest), frequent sexual topics, ways to disobey his dad . . . it just reminded me of my groomer.  and then, here's the worst part: guy decides to take chaitanya to see a **SEX WORKER**, and pays her to jump with her breasts out in front of chaitanya, who is TEN YEARS OLD. after the sex worker walks off, chaitanya then asks how much it would cost to touch the sex worker's breasts.  am i the only person who sees the problem here? a grown man, a complete *stranger*, takes a *ten year old* boy to see and touch a sex worker's breasts.  remember what i said about this being the worst part? well, here's the actual worst part: you may be saying that this is all fiction, so there's no reason to get all tRiGgErRed, but you need to realize that the actor was born in 2004, and the movie was released in 2013, meaning that the actor was only 8-9 years old during the recording.  ***does seriously nobody else see a problem with exposing 8-9 year old children to this stuff?!?***  putting that aside, i'm gonna rush the end of the review a bit because i got my main point out of the way and my phone is low on battery.  **spoilers**  so, you may be wondering why a 40 year old man has forced himself through this spelling bee, even while on national television.   well, wonder no longer, because i'll tell you: it's because the founder of the spelling bee is his father, and he's mad at his father for running out on him as a kid and wants to publicly embarass him.  really. that's it. a grown ass man ruins hundreds of children's experience with a spelling bee because he's mad at his daddy.   sorry bateman, but this movie is fucking weird and shouldn't have been made."

I remembered it from my own teen years as being a bit of a failure. Fresh from the rewatch I'd say that was an accurate assessment, but I feel people overlook a lot of the things it got right. Michael Jai White gives a real powerhouse performance and his physicality is immense. I can't imagine anyone else doing that better. Oh, let's be honest, the actual physical suit (rather than the very poor CGI) is one of the best comic to film translations of a character's outfit. John Leguizamo is a wonderful page-perfect Clown (even if some of the lines he's given are pretty poor), and the discomfort of his suit shouldn't be overlooked either. That he pulled it off is a testament to his commitment and talent, he should be more appreciated. And say what you will, but I really enjoyed Martin Sheen's scenery chewing turn as the corporate villain. Looks like he had fun. Also, the film has a rocking soundtrack and a great punk-goth aesthetic. That combined was certainly enough for me to overlook the flaws and inconsistent tone, and my kid loved it. It's certainly no worse than some of the shit DCU and MCU have pumped out. It didn't play safe, it was fairly faithful, and it remains an oddity. Perhaps the most frustrating thing about the film is how easily it could have been better. Anyway, that's my piece."

A lot of the complaints I saw of Bros are similar to Strange World: generic motifs done in a generic way, and blatant in its preachiness/explanations instead of using the experience of the story make its points.  I really enjoyed Uncoupled because it has a genuine approach to relationships that treats it as a human experience rather than the experience of one group or another.

I've been enjoying the Wednesday series fine, but it's admittedly made me yearn for a return of this type of charactered content in feature form.  This trend of limited series on cable and streaming services has  certainly had its positive attributes, but it's also permitted a lot of overindulgence and time-filling in the scripting and editing stages. Outside of the likes of A24, a tight 100-minute runtime where every beat is a precision strike feels oddly antiquated of late.  A couple of friends and I talked last night and we each ranked Burton's films. While there were plenty of differences, we did find that all of our top 7-8 titles were the same in some order. Would love to hear where others stand on this, as I'm admittedly unclear as to what the general public opinion is of Burton's more contemporary work. I certainly know my opinion, but that of others interests me.  Here's my ranking. Feel free to question and judge; I'll defend my choices in the comments:  1.) Ed Wood   2.) Edward Scissorhands   3.) Big Fish   4.) Batman Returns   5.) Batman   6.) Beetlejuice   7.) Pee-Wee's Big Adventure   8.) Sweeney Todd   9.) Sleepy Hollow   10.) Big Eyes   11.) Corpse Bride   12.) Mars Attacks!   13.)

Not compared to the crooked cops, media mavens, and wrathful wardens. The treatment of women here is also interesting. Laden with abuse, assault, fetishistic scopophilia, and torture porn- we still manage to find feminism if you know how to look for it right. Though the lens runs over these scenes objectively, the viewer must see themselves as the victimized woman and be disgusted and angered by what is happening to her- to feel monstrous about watching it happen and understand the plight of why such women want revenge. Set against the wide open spaces of the ever-psychedelic southwest, with big red cars and southern drawls, this tinges on the fever dream of the frontier west. A 5/5 for me."

Thus, a movie which meets the following requirements:  * The movie DOES NOT have at least two men in it * If it does have two men, they do NOT talk to each other * If they do talk to each other, it's ONLY about women  Thank you to everyone in advance :)  EDIT: Extra points for movies that are enjoyable \\^\\^"

(I'm majoring in film is why I'm looking for more important recommendations than just casual enjoyment.)  Despite the fact that I'm a film major, I'm still very much one of those people who won't turn on a movie because I feel like I don't have time, and then proceed to watch 6 hours of a TV show.   To clarify, I'm not cinematically illiterate and have seen a good amount of the go-to “classics” like The Godfather movies, Rocky, Pulp Fiction, etc. However, I don't consider myself to be a film buff and I feel like I need to expand the list of movies I've seen. I'm basically trying to train myself to become a film buff—to an extent. (I'm not trying to be the stereotypical pretentious film major bro that glorifies Quentin Tarantino.)

I also don't have a problem with comedy adventure, triller kinds but the Action is requirement!A few examples that I really really like was : American Ninja, Death Wish, Lethal Weapon (movies and series) , Rambo and more. I like that fact that the sequels are always better than the first one even the first one has always higher rating in imdb. I have seen many of them so if you can recommend me some (not very popular) movies It would be easier for me not to have saw them already and i also would be much obliged.Thanks in advanced.

        "body": "I'm rewatching the series and the second and third film are usually noted as the worst of the franchise, which is pretty fair but I think they're still worth watching if I'm going to watch everything. In the third movie they think there is a mole feeding Davien information and they keep trying to push that it's Brassel even though it's the kind of stuff that is so obvious that no actual intelligence agent would take it serious, like calls from his office being linked to Davien when if Brassel was the mole he wouldn't be making calls I could be traced back to his office. Ethan Hunt is captured and is told that he will die but Julia, his wife, will live if he answers all their questions. Then the real mole, Musgrave, comes into question Ethan himself. This makes no sense because Ethan has shown no hesitation towards Musgrave, and even called him to give him information to protect the very thing he stole in order to save his wife since they can't go to terrorist. Nothing Ethan has said or did would lead Musgrave to believe that Ethan even suspects Musgrave is the mole, then asks if the information he got from another agent confirms that the agent that they're setting up, Brassel, looks like the mole and not him. Would Musgrave should know because Ethan has been relying on Musgrave for certain things that he wouldn't if he suspected him as a traitor. After this stupidity, he continues as stupidity by agreeing to Ethan wanting proof of life of Julia before he continues the questions and instead of putting the phone on speaker, puts the phone right next to Ethan's head when Musgrave knows that Ethan is essentially the best operative they've ever had and Musgrave is someone that only works in the office not actually in the field. It might be my biggest flaw of the movie just because the only reason Ethan gets to win is because one person that should know better does multiple stupid things at once letting Ethan win. He ends up being so useless at the end that he walks in and Julia just shoots him without him even looking like he he had the capability of using his gun. If Musgrave would have at least left someone else in the room so that Ethan did try to escape some with some skill or gun could have stopped him, or if he did anything logically at the end, maybe the bad guys would have won. Every time I see that scene is the most annoying thing in the franchise."

        "body": "*In case the title didn't tell you already, this is my absolute favorite of this trilogy. I remember that this was the first one I saw in the theater, and I especially remember watching this one the most times. This one felt like, “okay, we got past the boring stuff, and now let's get on to the main event.” To me, this one felt the most interesting and intense out of all of them, and for good reason too. We finally get to see Smaug the dragon in all his glory! More on him later though.*  Plot: Bilbo and the company of dwarves continue their journey to the Lonely Mountain. Meanwhile, Gandalf goes on his own side quest….  Characters: Not only do you have the previous characters from the last movie, but you have some new characters as well. Once again, Bilbo Baggins, played again as Martin Freeman, is the best character/actor in the movie. In the last movie, he started a great character arc where he gained a lot of courage over the course of the journey. In this movie, that courage grows. !<In the scene with Smaug near the end, Bilbo shows great courage while talking to a dragon that would kill him at any given chance. All while he's trying to steal the Arkenstone because it's a family heirloom for Thorin.!< For the dwarves, they're mostly the same: Thorin acts like a jerk to Bilbo sometimes, and the other dwarves act nice to Bilbo. >!Speaking of the dwarves, one of them, Kili, played by Aidan Turner, has a weird, pointless romance with an elf named Tauriel, played by Evangeline Lilly. Not only is this perhaps the most unnecessary addition to the story in my opinion, but they have no chemistry. What did she see in him? Sure they talked some, but I don't see it.!< >!At one point in the movie, and in the book, Gandalf leaves the company to deal with an ancient evil. As to who the ancient evil is, it's kinda obvious that it's gonna be Sauron. The whole buildup was to the identity was basically shouting out “it's totally not Sauron.”!<  Tone: The second installment of The Hobbit trilogy.  Music: Like with *An Unexpected Journey*, this also delivers good music. The music is filled with wonder, but mostly suspense.   Smaug: We are finally at the meat of what I wanted to talk about since I've started reviewing this trilogy. This is, what I think to be,  the best part about this movie. Some people even claimed that this is the scariest part of the whole movie. It's Smaug the dragon. Now why do I like this guy so much? His first appearance in the movie while the suspenseful music is playing is very bone chilling, and gives a feeling of dread, making this a perfect and suspenseful scene. Benedict Cumberbatch delivers a scary, yet memorable performance for the character. It's kinda weird how in the first movie, Smaug had four limbs with blue scales, but they redesigned him with two bat-like forelimbs with red-golden scales. I heard in the blu ray version of the first movie's extended edition, they changed that design in the movie to fit this movie's redesign. I do think it's pretty cool whenever Smaug gets ready to breathe fire, his chest glows orange. Similar to how Godzilla's dorsal fins glow blue/red/orange when he gets ready to breathe fire. There is one thing that makes me question about Smaug: After he took over Erebor and fell asleep in the treasure, did he ever go outside to get some food and water? I'd be starving and thirsty if I waited that long.   *The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug* is an improvement over the first movie, and perhaps the favorite in this trilogy.   Rating: 7.5/10"

        "body": "So, I've been meaning to watch this movie for years and heard nothing but praise about it. The first 25-30ish minutes of it are great. But, as soon as you get past the most famous scene in the movie (the one where he puts on the glasses for the first time) it falls apart for me because the main character SUCKS.  First, even before anything goes down, he tells a black man that “the middle of the road is the worst place to drive”. When all he was trying to do was keep his head down, get paid and send money back to his family in Detroit that he hadn't seen in months. The ONLY thing this guy asked from our main character was to leave him alone and not bring whatever bullshit he was stirring up his way. Then, he proceeded to not only do exactly the opposite of what he asked of him (which was VERY little), but BEATS THE SHIT OUT OF HIM? 5 fucking minutes of beating the shit out of this poor guy just to put glasses on him to totally derail his life and sanity. Not to mention the absolute steaming pile of white man privilege he dumps on him with complete confidence when he initially asks him to leave him out of it because he wants to keep his head down. And after all of this he gets his ass killed. He also acts like a total moron 50% of the time he's wearing the glasses, drawing the MOST attention to himself possible. He was also suuuuper rapey to that woman he kidnapped. Am I alone on this? Everyone loves this movie and no one mentions that this guy is an absolute unchanged colostomy bag of a person. And it isn't just that. It was such a weird tonal change (and to be honest, quality change) after the glasses scene. But, what I mainly wanted to know is does anyone else see this guy like I do or is it just me? Just one more thing to add: I love John Carpenter films. This one just was really disappointing for me and not just because the main guy is an idiot. Just wanted to see if anyone else was feeling this way about the protagonist."

In fact it was one of the brilliant campaign with out of the box modus being used. The movie on the other hand had its moments and was being creative with the usage of the jump scares, but the way it ended left a lot to be desired.   The starting point was that how it was an educated and intelligent women that was going through that ordeal, and she was not only a healthcare professional, but a mental healthcare expert. Of all the people to believe that crackpot theories, she is supposed to be the least susceptible when it comes to believing that crap. It also press forth the point that how mental health is like something of a curse that cannot be broken, and if one of the person in your family is suffering from the issue, then you are bound to be affected by it and you cannot do much about it.   Being a mental healthcare expert, her first reaction would have been to make sense of some of the things that are happening in her surroundings. Instead she starts to investigate the curse and how people in the past are affected by it. In some ways, it tends to do a disservice to the mental health issues. There is already stigmatization and with the movies like this, it is not really helping the cause.   On a side note, has anyone noticed that most of the movies in which protagonist is going insane and is affected by it, 90 % if the cases are showed to be women. Is there is casual sexism in it that how these curses only tend to affect women due to being a weaker sex that can be easily manipulated."

I also have to add that Chris Hemsworth plays the villain very well and I wish he'd play the antagonist role more. The plot is overall very well-written, even though it's not perfect and has a few smaller problems, but they don't really take away from the experience and are barely noticable. It's also a lot like a Tarantino film. The cinematography is beautiful and the soundtrack is spectacular. Deep Purple's Hush has been playing in my head ever since I watched the movie. And in the end, the film ends in a satisfying and very amusing way, leaving a few uncovered mysteries. One more thing: I'd recommend not watching the trailer before the movie, as it spoils a few things. This is definietly a must watch for everyone who likes slower, mysterious, tense but also occasionally funny thrillers with great twists and satisfying conclusions."

        "body": "I'm an old (47M) GenX'er who grew up with HBO being my babysitter in the 80s. While I would eventually grow into loving foreign films and appreciating the finer details of filmmaking, I cut my teeth on the movies HBO probably thought were filler during the day (and were mostly safe for kids like me) but they ended up being the movies I still carry with me to this day.  The thing is, for every Neverending Story that people more or less remember, there are movies like Krull that completely melted my mind or movies like One More Saturday Night (that I finally found out today was available to stream) which seem like complete throwaways but were \\*really\\* fun films.  So, what I'm hoping someone out there can help with is offering some movies that are in this what I would call 80s Goldilocks Zone as movies that were fun (comedy, adventure, action) but weren't at all heady, popular, and most likely one of the last things still available to rent on VHS on any given Friday or Saturday night at the video store.  I know there are other gems out there that would be incredible to experience for the first time so if you have any suggestions I would love to give them a run.  BTW, if you're wanting more examples of what I would call these 80s Goldilocks Zone movies, here's a short list that I put together:  **The Manhattan Project** (a **100% perfect** example of this type of 80s movie; plus, it stars John Lithgow, Cynthia Nixon, and John Mahoney)  **Rad** (yeah, people eventually came around on this one but I swear I wore out the videotape that I dubbed this on back in the day and it IS a perfect movie)  **BMX Bandits** (what an intro to world cinema; starring Nicole Kidman in one of her best roles to date, the movie is all about...walkie-talkies?)  **Real Genius** (probably on the outer edges of what was not very popular as it had an $8M budget and eventually brought in $13M but I rented this movie so many times and am tickled it's now out on 4K)  **Kuffs/Heathers/Pump up the Volume** (Christian Slater was tops in these, even though Pump up the Volume was released in 1990, but, for my money, Kuffs is flat out great)  **The Heavenly Kid** (Rotten Tomatoes says it's only 30% but my nostalgia says otherwise)  **My Science Project** (Fisher Stevens seemed to be everywhere in the 80s, plus Dennis Hopper is in the movie and this came out in 1985 with Blue Velvet coming out in 1986; not saying there's a connection but there couldn't be more of a difference in performances.  **Last Starfighter** (My intro to Sci-Fi. SIGH.)  **Explorers** (River Phoenix, Ethan Hawke in a rock-solid kid-friendly movie)  **Brewster's Millions and The Toy** (I remember Brewster's for the shiny baseball uniforms and the awesome ending when he punches Stephen Collins in the face who, looking at that man's life now, seems about right)  **Dirt Bike Kid** (Peter Billingsly post-Christmas Story. It literally blew this 10 year-old's mind that an actor could appear in more than one movie)  **Summer Rental** (John Candy, Rip Torn, and Richard Crenna make an insanely fun trio; plus, no matter how old I get I still find myself saying, for no reason at all, Your wife's on my WHAM-O.)  **Time Bandits** (My first taste of Terry Gilliam. I think it melted my consciousness. I love him for this movie alone)  **Three O'clock High** (Casey Siemaszko, Richard Tyson, and Jeffrey Tambor in a pitch-perfect movie that is directed insanely well, has a great pace, and has a great story; it received its due with a Blu-ray release but I cherish this movie)  **Summer School** (Mark Harmon and Kirstie Alley at the height of their powers, this movie is a funny ode to youth and the problems that come with being young; back when I had to rent this as a kid I had a tape recorder and \\*recorded\\* the movie's best bits so I could listen to them back later)  **Hiding Out** (Jon Cryer may forever be Duckie to some but this is a great, breezy view)  **License to Drive** (Back when getting your license was the ONLY thing you obsessed about as a teen, this movie starring the two Coreys, and Heather Graham, still is a lot of fun)  **Loverboy/Can't Buy Me Love/Run** (Yeah, Run is from 1991 but this triptych represents Patrick Dempsey's BEST work and I only 1/2 wish I was kidding)  **Moving Violations** (Starring Bill Murray's OTHER brother. No, not Brian Doyle-Murray, the OTHER brother, John Murray. It also stars Jennifer Tilly who is just amazingly funny.)  **Going Ape** (Come for the Tony Danza and stay for the orangutans and a silly Danny DeVito; I don't know if these primates were treated well but they add a metric ton to the humor of this movie)  **How I Got Into College/One Crazy Summer/Better Off Dead** (Savage Steve Holland forever)"

        "body": "I just watched 500 days of summer and I loved it. The movie starts of by showing how Tom and Summer had broken up, and then going back to the start of them knowing each other. This gives the viewer knowledge of what is to   come. Without this, I feel that the movie would have felt different. The movie would have changed to be about optimistic love story to a story with twist and turns that will ultimately end in heartbreak. This flash forward only goes to about half way through the characters knowing each other, which doesn't completely spoil the movie and keeps the viewer wondering what might happen after. I thought that after they broke up, they would get back together, but they never did. Tom keeps trying to get back with her, but he never does and ends up presumedly finding love.   The movie darting around from the start of their relationship to the end is a great way of showing that the relationship went wrong, but leaves the viewer curios of how it went wrong. Throughout the movie, I get on thinking that Summer and Tom were great for each other, but the flash forwards did not support this. During the flash backs, Summer says that she does not believe in love. This helps the viewer partially understand why they might break up. This is then reassured during their final meeting, all the way at the end of the movie.  What did you guys think of the movie?"

Grace could have gotten killed so many times throughout the movie, but she gets help instead so she is not killed. It kind of made it unrealistic and scripted to me.   5. I see people comparing this to you're next. But I think they are nothing alike. Erin is much better than Grace. Grace was a mess.

The first half is fairly creepy as Jacob finds himself in a strange New York hellscape, and it's unclear if he's hallucinating, hunted by demons, dreaming this while he's dying, or has already died and stuck in some type of purgatory. The last possibility was actually the most interesting to me, and there was a very creepy atmosphere over the entire first half where things just didn't feel quite right.  Then halfway through that seems to almost all disappear and it seems to become a story about a guys who were experimented on that are trying to get answers about what happened to them from the government. Them realizing they government experimented on them, trying to get a lawyer to take their case, being intimidated by the government, the chemist coming out and explaining what happened etc. It seems to be a good explanation for what was happening during the first half, and everything that happens in the second half fits in with the government conspiracy premise. The ambiguity seems to be gone. I think there's only one time the demons return during the second half, which is when he's in the hospital. But the fact that these are now being presented as his hallucinations take a lot of the punch out of that scene.  Then in the last 2-3 minutes, we find out the entire thing was a dying dream, but also suggest that the whole experimented on part of the dream was something that really happened.  Also the whole the devils are really angels speech was strange, because there didn't seem to be any ambiguity to the creatures in the first half. They were really malevolent creatures that seemed to want to torment him, not free him from the past. Likewise we're told that he needs to let go of the past to move on, but the ending is him choosing to go back to his past over his new life and moving on from their (choosing to keep trying to find out what happened in Vietnam when his friends had moved on, choosing to go back to his old house, finally leaving with his son).  Interesting film, but I was left with the feeling they didn't really know what they wanted it to be, and it probably would have been a lot stronger if it was three separate films."

Ina dystopian future, people's emotions are controlled via medication or a bracelet or something. Everyone is docile and have no emotional reaction. They are all the same. Two people become aware and bring down the establishment and free the people to feel. I can think of “A Wrinkle in Time” where Charles Wallace goes to find I.T.

It would be a great change -up for the Bond character, while giving a remarkable actor a chance to put her mark on an iconic franchise.   She's been overlooked.  ETA:  I guess I didn't think about tossing the franchise on its head, and I wouldn't want to look to make any political statements with the casting.  I understand James Bond is James Bond.

I wanted to fill in the gaps in my knowledge of his stuff so I threw this on Amazon Prime earlier and enjoyed it quite a bit.  The story's really interesting, and this period of the last decade or so of the Cold War isn't one that I'm most familiar with so I learned a lot from this. Sorkin tells it in a really clear and gripping way and in hindsight I think there's some really interesting parallels to draw between this situation and what's happening in Ukraine.  But I think the performances might be the standout component here. Tom Hanks is unsurprisingly great. Hearing him speak Aaron Sorkin dialogue is a real pleasure that I'm glad exists as a film fan. And even though he doesn't play villain here like he does in Ladykillers, seeing him play even a somewhat flawed character is still really cool and unique to see. Despite the accent, I enjoyed him in Elvis for this very reason.  Phillip Seymour Hoffman is also excellent. He's probably the funniest character (at least for me, since his dry, sarcastic sense of humor matched well with mine), but I liked that he wasn't just the comic relief. His knowledge of the situation is vital to the narrative and the discussions between him and Hanks as to how to go about this were really cool. The more I see from this guy the more I miss him. Such a unique talent.  And even though they're smaller roles, I was glad to see that Amy Adams and Julia Roberts had something interesting to do. (Roberts especially. I think this might be her best work besides Erin Brokovich. Whenever she steps outside the romcom genre I find her performances are better for it.)  If I had a minor gripe I'd say that even though it's quite short I do think it could've been shortened a little more. Not a lot, it's just that the editing is a little slow in spots so there's certain cuts that could come a little faster and shave 5 minutes off the runtime, if that.  But I think this is a very worthy addition to Sorkin's filmography. Not his best movie by any means, but not his worst either. Well worth watching if you're a fan of his or interested in the subject matter."

I have contacted the film's producer (Tom Karnowski) and the film's cinematographer (Chuck Minsky) and both only have the original pan & scan version on VHS. Albert wanted a proper widescreen release.      Alamo Drafthouse screen Radioactive Dreams a few years back, and I have sent their twitter handles messages but have no received a response.

I always assumed that Lecter in fact WAS talking about the scratch on her hand, but after watching the movie again recently, I wonder if he was pointedly referring to her period. If it was her hand, I would think he would have made a more direct statement, like “Tell me about your hand, Clarice” or even commented that he was still able to hurt people while in his cell.  Clarice's reaction made me think that this possibility occurred to her as well (and that he was correct) and she changed the subject to keep him from going down that path, and out of shock from his being even more intuitive than she first realized.  It's a pretty minute point, but did anyone else think that's what he meant?"

For example the way he delivered his rant on anyone going about saying Merry Christmas and chuckling at the thought of boiling them in their own pudding.

I'd assume the idea is that only older movies can be fine with a Strong Female Character, but then Alitta: Battle Angel is apparently good and not woke  Then there's having any kind of Gay Relationship automatically means woke, even if that's the point of the movie. Are gay relationships not allowed in film, even with a minor character like in Lightyear?  I just don't understand, so what is any movie at all with Gay characters in suddenly bad because its woke?

For instance, here in Finland and Sweden in some form as well, there's a belief that a figure called Canute takes away Christmas every 13th of January. As you might expect, this figure is also based on a Saint like Santa; most likely St. Canute of Denmark whose feast day incidentally falls on 7th of January so you can definitely get some lucky/unlucky parallers there. As for the plot, him 'taking away Christmas' would naturally make Santa and the elves fearful of his presence but it's ultimately a necessary job to be repeated every year.

One day when she's not there, he yells at the server  The Manager, having had enough of him sternly tells him to leave the restaurant even after giving his regular spiel. The Manager has had enough and sternly demands he leave  If you haven't watched the scene, I'm sure that YouTube has it.

When Melvin asks how the night was, they say it was better than sex. That leads me to believe they were onto his plan. It's either that or I might be reading into it more... knowing this film I'm not lol  While at the restaurant in their destination, Melvin utters the classic line You make me want to be a better man I feel as if I don't care at that point. He's probably giving as much growth as he is possible of showing  All in all, while he did grow, maybe I didn't want to tolerate that character as much as the cast did, but (it's a movie ofc) I think overall he's someone that might have been a headline in the age of social media  Originally, this started off as discussing my favorite scene where people didn't take his shit  and ended up being why I think this character is shit and irredeemable, even if he does good deeds.

The cinematography, horror, and gruesome aesthetic of the scenery of the film make it one of the most beautiful films of the year. Also with the great acting of the two main actors. Maren and Lee are played by Taylor Russell and Timothee Chalamet, they both gave their best performances here, especially Taylor who plays the main character.   Most of the film is focused on her and her emotions toward her lifestyle of her being a cannibal, she battles with her feelings on the topic and how it's changed her and then sees a reflection of herself in Timothee's character Lee. I have seen Taylor Russell in other projects, but this is her best performance yet, I was hooked from the beginning. Timothee has always been amazing in every film he's in, he always gives it his all, and what a performance this was. I truly think this is his best performance as an actor.   Not only was the cinematography and suspense in every scene beautifully well done, but also the score of the film was sentimental, there were a lot of hidden meanings to certain scenes with metaphors, and with the amazing cinema, the score, and the directing you could see what Luca was going for. I never read the book so I don't know if this follows the source material well, but I can say that this was a great film, I didn't know how far the plot would go, but once it took off I didn't want it to stop, the ending is sad.   One thing that I loved that the film focused on the most was the romance between Lee and Maren. Bones and All is truly just a love story and a beautiful one that almost made me cry by the end I'll give it an 8.1/10. This film is very creepy, gruesome, gross, and very Rated R for a reason. Some people even walked out of the theater I was in because it was too much, but not for me."

The bad: The overall story is unexplained. I wanted to know more about this demon thing. But was left hanging. Overuse of jump scares. I don't mind one here and there, but when most of the scary parts are loud noises with someone (something) appearing and going away, it takes away from it.   The ugly: The entity, demon or whatever is just ugly looking. It was the least scary part of the movie to me. Before it opens its face it looks like Michael Jackson, after it looks like Grimmace. This seriously undid all of the set up to the movie.   Notes: The movie seems like it may set up for a sequel, however the weakness's of this movie didn't really make me interested in a potential sequel.  The movie feels like a mesh of The Happening and Final Destination with a demon entity added in. Overall an interesting combination that worked really well, until it didn't."

It's gotten to the point where I will ask my sister will ask me if I want to watch it. Of course with big shows they wait for me (like all the marvel and star wars Disney plus shows). And sadly a few times they watched things without me, I got mad. I just love that feeling of sitting with my sister and parents and watching something new. Sure we can split up and just watch things at our own pace but I would be sad. Does anyone else do this?"

        "body": "I'm a huge fan of the podcast Last Podcast on the Left and its brother and sister shows, and for years and years Nothing But Trouble has been a running joke amongst all the hosts. They're allways dropping references to it, named a tour after the movie, and even started a joke campaign to raise the Rotten Tomatoes score, which resulted in the score dropping, because in their words People are actually watching it and realizing it really isn't a very a good movie!  Sure enough it's got a 5/10 on IMDb and a 13% on Rotten Tomatoes, so between that and these various podcasts always admitting the movie actually does suck, I was a little turned off about watching it, but last night I finally gave it a go and wound up having a blast.  I mean, for starters Dan Aykroyd is just hilarious going full ham as the judge. I feel like if just about any other actor did that role it'd be unwatchable, but Dan Aykroyd's got some sort of charm to him that makes the character an absolute riot.   I also absolutely loved the visuals, there was something about the chaotic, spooky junkyard setting that was really aesthetically pleasing to me. It reminded of the I, Spy books I read as a kid, where each page was this intricately detailed setpiece and you'd have to find bits and pieces in each scene.  Then you just have how unhinged and weird the movie was. You have the dinner scene, you have John Candy both as a cop and as his own sister, which is just John Candy with a dress, makeup, a wig, and fake tits, you have the judge executing people with the Mad Max-esque rollercoaster, the Bonesplitter, you have the whole scene with the judge bringing in a bunch of rappers (including a pre-fame Tupac Shakur, oddly enough) and performing a rap number with them, with him jamming out an organ solo, which ultimately winds up being a pretty pointless scene, you have the grotesque diaper-wearing man-baby twins, Bobo and Lil Debbul, you have the judge's nose looking like a dick at a random points of the movie, there's just so many strange moments and details in Nothing But Trouble that make it the ultimate What the fuck am I watching?! flick.  I almost don't even know if I can really recommend it or not since it technically isn't that great of a movie, but it's so batshit insane that it somehow loops around to be extremely fun to watch. I think I'm mostly curious how many other broken people there are out there that enjoy it as much as I do."

But what about the Ye Olden Times?  Prey rewinds the clock back 300 years to the Native American Comanche times to let us meet Naru, a Comanche medic. Sorry, *healer* is the correct term here. Even though she's teached in the ways of medicine, she wants to be a hunter, aided by her good buy Sarii. Out hunting, she sees a spaceship, which she believes to be a Thunderbird, something Wikipedia tells me is a legendary mighty creature for Native Americans. Determined it will be her way of proving herself as a hunter, she sets out to kill whatever it is. If it bleeds, we can kill it. (Which I actually said right before the movie did.)  At a tight 100 minutes with credits, the movie holds a tight pace. Tight movies are *tight*. The movie builds itself up to the ultimate showdown of ultimate destiny. Introduce the fighters, show their abilities, have them cross paths, and boom boom boom, boom boom, badilla life.  Amber Midthunder (who actually *is* Native American along with the other actors in the Comanche cast) is as strong in the role of Naru as Naru is in the movie. The Predator's threat is increasingly shown in the beautifully shot action scenes. My lord, this movie looks beautiful. The sound and music is great, building up the tension.  Strong lead + beautiful camera work + great action + tight pace and runtime = A damn good and enjoyable hunt, ehrm, movie."

Paul Mescal was brilliant in it as was the young girl playing Sophie. Such natural scenes between the two of them that it never felt like they were acting at all.  The scene of Callum sobbing on the bed was just so jarring to watch. I felt like he was in such inner turmoil within himself but was doing his best to cover it up... always moving onto the next activity...the tai chi...books to try and cure him of his illness...him saying he didn't think he'd make it to 40...the lack of care in his wellbeing with his broken wrist and almost getting hit by the bus. He really captured how much of depression is suffering in silence but doing your best to just keep going in the hope it'll get better but slowly losing hope when each day you feel worse and worse.  Sophie was a brilliant character as well. Such a natural actress and I loved the idea that as children we see our parents are superheroes and are oblivious to how much they can be struggling but we still pick up on subtle signs that all is not well beneath the surface.

From the scene in the hospital to car fights to even the apartment fights, each one was executed beautifully. Not overdone and hella realistic in terms of team members dying and stuff.  Next the plot:  My god, the plot was insane. It was very fast-paced (which is a refreshing difference from other Wahlberg movies) and it was a ROLLERCOASTER. The connection between the plot and the Russian boy was just amazing. It wasn't even so much of a plot twist so much as it was just beautifully done. I mean honestly, it was such a brilliantly done full circle.  Third: this is validation that rotten tomatoes is bull  20%??????

I get really interested in the career paths of actors and what their resumes say  Powell has had many voice-acting gigs and tv roles. I guess his biggest TV role would be a 16-episode stint in Scream Queens.   However, even before then, Powell was working alongside some of the biggest names in action in Expendable 3.   Then, Powell was in Hidden Figures, alongside a whole new batch of acting powerhouses.   Then, Powell took a stab at co-starring in the Rom-Com Set It Up.   Then, just 4 years later, Powell was cast in goddamn Top Gun: Maverick, in a major role. Some would say that the pecking order, in terms of character importance, in that movie was Cruise, Teller, Powell.   Now, Powell is the literal co-star in Devotion, alongside someone who's experiencing his own career boom, Jonathan Majors.   Have we been seeing Powell creeping closer and closer to that movie star spotlight? The guy can act, and it seems like Hollywood is agreeing."

The first time I watched it I went to the movie theatre so excited and ready for an epic amazing story and when it happened I was in complete and utter shock. I cried, my heart dropped and everything seemed to go silent. The way I felt, the shock of it all, was an absolute brick wall that left me emotionally bruised.   When I think about it for too long I get shivers. I've never discussed how this movie has made me feel with anybody but I wonder if it was a little traumatizing to watch as a child or if it was one of those movies that just kind of teaches children the way of the world.   I think of my own life and having similar circumstances occur to me when I was 10 it was all just a little jarring.   Incredibly beautiful movie but extremely damaging to my psyche. One of the most impactful movies of my entire life second to only 'a little princess'."

I think the movies production and subsequent press stuff as really done the movie a major disservice, and that's a shame.  As always, Florence Pugh is incredible to watch. This movie engrossed me completely.  Reading that it had been somewhat watered down from the original Van Dyke brothers story is a shame, especially regarding the Jack character. If the movie had gone there, maybe it would've been better. But right now, I don't see really any flaws in the movie. I'm not saying it's perfect, but I do think the movie has received a lot more criticism than it deserves."

        "body": "Like leaving aside any trolling and boycotting, the ratings in IMDb have become more critical and realistic of movies. You do not get to see a lot of movies, which deserve 8+ score. They generally go between 6.5 and 7.5, which is accurate to me as I do not recall many standout productions in the last few years (due to COVID). You really have to be something else to get a score of 7.8 and above. That is not to say that movies have become worse in quality - I think that 7 out of 10 is a fairly okay score to have. In school it means that you did good. Not excellent, not amazing, but good. Even if I do not agree with the scores sometimes (most recently with the The Fabelmans), those movies who raise above the rest truly captivate people and are talked about whenever I go. I remember back in the day, when only fans would rate a production first, how inflated the score was. I had to wait several days or weeks for it to turn to a more realistic number. Maybe this is due to people becoming more critical of movies, which is excellent in my opinion, or there is a sort of a new algorithm they set, I dunno. Or movies have become more diverse. Or more people are watching them. I don't know. All I know is - as a person that can not have all of the time in the World I rely more on the score system than I did before and I am more often than not not disappointed as I go with fairly realistic expectations, knowing that the movie will be worth my time beforehand.     Edit: I am just going to post a comment I made in the thread to not repeat myself regarding why scores are important:  How can you tell if you are going to enjoy the movie? Let's all just gamble all of the time as it has been proven that even with excellent casting, director and screenwriters a movie can be a waste of your time (Amsterdam). It is so wonderful to decide for yourself when you have the time and the energy to do so. I am not going to spend 2 and half hours of my life just going blindly to something that can potentially piss me off. And reading reviews most of the time spoils the movie and the moods in it. Watching trailers does this too. You wanna know what does not spoil the movie, but tells you that you might enjoy it - score. How can you assign a score on a movie??? - did people like it and how much did they like it. This is how. Just by seeing the score I know many people enjoyed the movie and they felt it is a good movie. This is enough for me. I will invest my time. But people's opinions are subjective!. If many people with subjective opinions like a particular product, then you know that that product is good. Also, people have become more critical of mediocre movies, which cater to all audiences. It is not enough for them, they want more and so they rate the movie accordingly.  Also, there is nothing wrong with fan service, nostalgia and callbacks. Some people think that movies have to be this high form of art that should not target general audience. And this thread proves it. Movies are entertainment - they are there for you to forget the World around you and enjoy 2 or so hours of storytelling or thrills. It is that simple. If a movie can make a lot of people do that, I call it a good movie. And if those people give the movie a high score of their experience, I will go to see that movie. But, but movies are subjective, because all of the people are different!!! We are not that unique for this to be true. "

However, I can recommend it for being so scary, because I think it was meant to be.  I didn't like Nope at first. By at first, I mean within 3 days of having watched it.  I thought it was an overall very plain, ordinary kind of film. Nothing really stood out as fantastic. Then again, I'm traditionally more of a Christopher Nolan, Marvel kind of person. I like things that are a bit wackier and exciting. Less of a sophisticated film junkie.  Also, I'm not a fan of horror. It doesn't sit well with me, but I do like Jordan Peele's take on things, and thrillers (not just pure horror) are cool to me, which is why I've given his stuff a shot.  Anyways...  It's been months now since I've seen Nope, and it has had a profound effect on me.  Anytime someone mentions UFOs, seeing gray disks in the sky. Hell, even when I'm out driving and the sky looks a certain way, Nope (literally the word) comes straight into my brain.  And then along with the word, the feeling.  This kind of disturbing, sad feeling like when you read about a tragedy that makes you feel vulnerable and really impacts you. To be honest, I feel a bit scarred by the film. I would probably prefer to forget it. Get Out and Us didn't make me feel that way.  I only feel compelled to talk about this film because it wasn't as well received as Jordan Peele's others, but it's also not a film with the same kind of immediate impact. It's not until months have passed and you still have that disturbed, anxious feeling any time you remember the film that you realize Nope was actually a masterpiece."

They have 4 showings per day so far. By next week, it's cut down to 3.  For the most commercially successful director of all time, I'm pretty shocked at the lack of showings. I know it doesn't feature any big name actors, nor is it the typical Spielberg blockbuster...but it's still Spielberg. Are they waiting for the film to rake in better numbers before expanding it?

I could really expand my repertoire.   I also like movies/shows where I can learn about other cultures accurately. Whereas, I know some movie makers make a point to get all the cultural aspects correct and in detail. For example, I just watched Unorthodox on Netflix and it was informal to learn about the culture of Orthodox Judaism, which I knew nothing about before. It was a little depressing for my taste but I really liked learning all about another culture in an entertaining way. I also watch TGBBS which is interesting to learn about British culture.  I finally like feel-good movies and shows. For example, I just watched He's Just Not That Into You, which I liked. I also watch New Girl sometimes which is a happy show, but I really have a hard time finding a good happy show to watch."

She had a good parent that loved and supported her when she was young. She goes through trauma (the loss of her most supportive parent) around the age where she starts to develop her own personality/outlook on life.

She runs from a set of good parental figures at the first small conflict between them, and rebels by getting into a relationship with a creepy older guy who used his relationship with the good parental figures to get to her and is only interested in her for one reason. She gets in too deep with him, so the good parental figures redeem themselves in her eyes by stepping in and saving her when no one else could/would.

It reminds me of all the things i try to bury deep into my unconscious, but this movie brings them up and makes me think about them. It becomes obvious to me that the Optimism i have for the future of our society is simply me tricking myself in order to have a happy live, i just avoid thinking deeply about our collective situation and future, something that was hard when i was younger but as i get older i just care less and less, i have become more individual, selfish, nearsighted... and it worked and i will keep doing it regardless of the reality.  I truly think this movie is a intemporal masterpiece and as time goes by it will get more recognition.  Movies like this really reminds me of my love for films, movies that make me deeply think and emotional for hours and hours after watching them. Arrival and Mother! Are other movies that made me feel that way  I'm sorry for my bad English and my badly explained convuluted ideas, i just needed to get it off my chest."

The way it started, with Bruce Willis sneaking past security guards at an art museum on a skateboard, while singing show tunes, all I could think was, This is a genuinely terrible movie.  But then I had the thought, I don't think they could have made a worse movie if they tried.  And then, a light went on: Hudson Hawk was them making the worst movie they could. Tonally and in terms of characterization; in its set pieces.  And by the end, I was crying laughing. It's actually a really brilliant film, because of how perfectly, and in how many ways, it is just the worst film they could make. It's really perfect in this way.  Reading about it later, I saw it was a passion project of Bruce Willis'. And that really puts it in perspective: here's this guy who was one of the biggest stars in the world. And THIS was the film he truly wanted to make.  There is a reason for that. He spent his life immersed in film sets and understood how to transform all of that experience into a perfectly terrible film. The idea must have been hilarious to him, and I thought it was hilarious too."

With all that being said….one of the worst movies I've ever seen in my entire life. First of all the daughter is the worst character I've seen in a movie or tv show. She was screaming constantly man and it made me wonder why they even casted her in the movie. The son was ridiculous. Had a death wish just tryna help people. He is in a HUGE explosion radius but somehow miraculously is at the house waiting on the dad in the end of the movie. Tom Cruise with some crazy grenade plan that blows up the alien from inside. GET THE HELL OUT OF HERE. Not a single character in this movie I liked. Was routing for aliens.   Then as if all this wasn't bad enough these unstoppable aliens who have been planning this here for thousands of years? Millions of years? Are still somehow outsmarted by regular old nature because they didn't build up immunity and of course humans come out on top. If weapons couldn't get past the force field then how did birds? And even if they were weakened by no immunity they would not just die off over the course of a couple days.   I can not stand when movies always have this feel good ending man. Humans are always so smart and just can't be beat. I would love if the movie ended with the aliens just trampling over everything and everyone. Movie over.  Only good thing about this movie was the original idea itself.  Score : 3-10."

Of course, in most of these Hollywood themed movies, Los Angeles is mostly being represented as these elegant, perfect place, full of nostalgia. Maybe Babylon will change some of that.

We're talking about a kids movie that surprisingly appealed to adults to an extent (Facebook mums seem to be the only adults who can tolerate, let alone love the Minions), and since the Minions were the highlight for the kids who watched the movie, adults who took their kids to see it were pleasantly surprised with everything else (but still found the Minions annoying).   So after I fully ignored the Minions rewatching the first movie, I was reminded of the storyline, and of the film's main antagonist (voiced by Will Arnet), a corrupt bank manager who funded criminals to carry out large-scale crimes, including protagonist Gru. However, it is revealed that Vector, a criminal that is trying to pull off the same plan as Gru, is the bank manager's son and that the two of them planned to get rid of Gru to cut costs for their own personal gain, which they successfully did when the manager (think his name was Perkins) set Gru up by having Vector steal a shrink ray off Gru to make it look like Gru had failed.   However, we're now on I think the 6th film of this franchise, with a 7th and 8th on the way, and Gru never found this out, meaning Perkins got away with this, despite Vector being killed (it wasn't shown on screen because it needed to maintain a kid-friendly tone, but he's definitely dead given that he got launched into outer space and was left stranded there, where his oxygen levels would deplete in three minutes)  I haven't seen the second one in a long time, but didn't Gru then become a counter-terrorist in that one? Surely Perkins must have started funding other ambitious criminals after his son's death (which he may not even know about)? And surely Gru would realise this would be happening even though he never found out that Perkins actually set him up to fail his plans to steal that shrink ray? Six films, each grossing so much more than anybody would ever expect, and yet this hasn't been fixed or even addressed once? (I haven't seen all 6, only seen 1 and 2, but I went on IMDB and saw that Perkins wasn't in any of the sequels after 2, meaning he was never stopped by Gru or anybody.)   I'm fully aware that this is a kids movie and this issue will probably never be fixed because these sorts of movies aren't designed to be particularly plot-driven or focus on their serious aspects, but am I really the only one that noticed this? It seemed impossible not to notice when I rewatched this movie."

We're both college students, so our budget probably wouldn't cover much concessions if we bought it from the theater. I mean probably, but that stuff is way overpriced anyway.  When I was a kid I remember going to the theater all the time with my family. There was a dollar store right next to it so we always got packs of candy to bring in, and even though the rules stated that you couldn't bring outside food and drinks, from my understanding it was ok as long as it wasn't obvious. I later got to know people who worked there, and they didn't care.  I don't remember what the theater I used to go to was, but I know that the one I am going to go to is either an AMC or Galaxy, both have rules against bringing food and drinks in, and they both have rules saying they can refuse service to anyone, which makes me skeptical to the legality to all of this.

And the quality of the animation is just peerless (seriously, it really deserves to be seen on a big screen).  My only worry is that the movie could potentially struggle to find the same substantial audience overseas as his last two movies did, as it is a more explicitly 'Japanese' experience than either of them. But it absolutely deserves to find a home with Western audiences, too. If anybody had any lingering doubts that Shinkai is the heir to Miyazaki's legacy, this should be the final word."

        "body": "Yesterday at Thanksgiving, me and some family sat down to watch The Woman King. We were initially going to watch Wakanda Forever, but since we didn't have Disney+, this movie was the unfortunate second choice. Now I'd seen a lot of reviews for the film and it's historical inaccuracies. But I genuinely don't care. If it still works as a film, I'm good with it. And since there were no parts in most reviews on what actually made it a bad FILM, I was going in with an open mind.  And my mother wasted twenty dollars that she will never get back. The movie killed any tension it would have in the first five minutes.  The Agojie warriors attack some camping Oya soldiers. They had the element of surprise, but instead of displaying the intelligence and capability of the Agojie, they decide to just show how strong they are by giving that element of surprise up and just fighting the Oya (who outnumber them by like ten dudes) head on like the geniuses they are.  They best the Oya despite the number difference with ease with only one Agojie dying. This is a consistent theme with this movie by the way. So immediately the army of the main villain poses no threat. But this alone wasn't enough to completely end the movie. A lot of movie have strong characters beat a bunch of fodder. Who cares?  But that's until you get Oba, the main villain and the leader of the enemy tribe. He's the one who forced himself on Viola Davis' character. He is the main big bad boy. Now as the rest of the army is complete garbage, you'd EXPECT Oba to be some kind of challenge right? Boy was I wrong...  It was clear from the rest of the movie that Oba isn't very smart and not a great general given he keeps losing fights with more equipment and easily outnumbers the Agojie, so I'd expect that he'd be physically powerful. A skilled warrior with training that allows him to be a threat to the Agojie--what am I talking about? He isn't shit. He just BARELY manages to kill one Agojie soldier and gets injured in the process. Mind you, the Agojie who were injured in this fight were injured by gunfire, which they can't dodge (but if you're Viola Davis, you can literally deflect them with your sword), or slashed up by droves of Oya tribesmen.  If another Agojie attacked, he would be fucked because he's the equivalent of at most two average Agojie warriors. The elites would dominate him and this is shown by the absolute murder that is Viola Davis VS Oba. She was absolutely destroying him until he threw some dust in her eyes. He started beating her up for a few seconds before she turns the tables back and unceremoniously kills him like the total bitch he was.  What a travesty of filmmaking. There's nothing worse than an action movie with zero tension. And you may think this is simply a nitpick, but it isn't.  These two tribes were at war for YEARS (at least 19). If the Agojie are this strong and the Oya this weak, how haven't the Agojie beat the Oya however many years ago? It's a major plot point that's affected by this.  Such a disappointment   (Now take a look at the downvotes. My fault for thinking people on a subreddit about movies were ready for discussions about movies.)"

Below is a breakdown of all of the Whodunit movies I have seen from 2022. I would say all are worth watching.  Did I miss any?  # 1. Vengeance  **Writer/Director**: B.J. Novak - The Office, The Premise  **Cast**: B.J. Novak, Boyd Holbrook, Issa Rae, Ashton Kutcher, J. Smith Cameron  **Plot**: B.J. is a wanna-be podcaster looking into the death of a girl he hooked up with.  **Thoughts**: Slightly more dramatic in tone. The comedic moments tend to be dry, but often land. Tries to be a bit deeper at times and usually succeeds. Some may not love the end, but overall big fan.  **Runtime**: 1h 47m    **Streaming**: Peacock  # 2. Confess, Fletch  **Writer/Director**: Greg Mottola - Superbad, Adventureland  **Cast**: Jon Hamm, Lorenza Izzo, John Slattery, Kyle MacLachlan, Marcia Gay Harden  **Plot**: Ham is a former journalist who gets caught up in a scheme around stolen art.  **Thoughts**: Loose and light with some sillier moments. Becomes almost too convoluted, but wraps up nicely in the end. Wasn't a huge fan of Chevy Chase's Fletch, but liked Hamm in the role.  **Runtime**: 1h 38m   **Streaming**: Showtime  # 3. Bodies Bodies Bodies  **Writer/Director**: Halina Reijn/Sarah DeLappe - no notable prior works  **Cast**: Maria Bakalova, Amandla Stenberg, Pete Davidson, Rachel Sennott, Lee Pace  **Plot**: A group of friends party at a summer home during a storm and murderous chaos ensues.  **Thoughts**: Some may not believe this is a comedy, but it has some pretty funny moments. Every character is unlikeable. but that is intentional. Gets intense at times compared to the rest of the list.  **Runtime**: 1h 34m   **Streaming**: Digital VOD  # 4. Chip 'n Dale: Rescue Rangers  **Director**: Akiva Schaffer - Popstar: Never Stop Never Stopping, Hot Rod  **Cast**: Andy Samberg, John Mulaney, Will Arnet, J.K. Simmons, Seth Rogen  **Plot**: Live action take on the famous TV chipmunks. The duo reunite to find their friend.  **Thoughts**: Surprisingly funny and a decent mystery. Plenty of meta humor and pop culture references. Overall a very easy and enjoyable watch.  **Runtime**: 1h 37m   **Streaming**: Disney+  # 5. Death on the Nile  **Director**: Kenneth Branagh - Murder on the Orient Express, Belfast, Cinderella  **Cast**: Kenneth Branagh, Gal Gadot, Armie Hammer, Annette Benning, Russell Brand  **Plot**: Famed detective Hercule Poirot tries to solve a murder during a couple's honeymoon in Egypt.  **Thoughts**: Not too comedic, but adding it to the list because if I didn't every comment would mention it. Decent enough take on the Agatha Christie novel, if slightly over long and possibly predictable.  **Runtime**: 2h 7m   **Streaming**: Hulu  # 6. See How They Run  **Writer/Director**: Mark Chappell/Tom George - no notable prior works  **Cast**: Sam Rockwell. Saoirse Ronan, Ruth Wilson, Adrien Brody, David Oyelowo  **Plot**: The director of an upcoming film adaptation of a famous play is murdered after the 100th show.  **Thoughts**: Light and easy to watch. Rockwell and Ronan do well with what they are given. There are a couple of decent twists and turns, but overall it is a pretty run of the mill murder mystery.  **Runtime**: 1h 38m   **Streaming**: HBO Max  # 7. Amsterdam  **Writer/Director**: David O. Russell - The Fighter, Silver Linings Playbook, American Hustle  **Cast**: Christian Bale, Margot Robbie, John David Washington, Rami Malek, Robert DeNiro  **Plot**: Two WW1 Vets and their friend try to figure out who may have killed their general from the war.  **Thoughts**: The reviews will likely make it seem worse than it is. The runtime did not seem to drag and the performances were good, but it is a bit goofier and more complicated than it needed to be.  **Runtime**: 2h 14m   **Streaming**: Digital VOD  # 8. Scream  **Writer/Director**: Tyler Gillett/Matt Bettinelli-Olpin - Ready or Not, V/H/S  **Cast**: Melissa Barrera, Jack Quaid, David Arquette, Neve Campbell, Courtney Cox  **Plot**: The Ghostface killer is back for a fifth time to kill some teens in Woodsboro, CA.  **Thoughts**: Some suspenseful moments, but still plenty of laughs. Does it rehash a lot from the original Scream? Sure. Does its meta spin on the material still keep you entertained? I thought so.  **Runtime**: 1h 54m   **Streaming**: Showtime  # 9. Enola Holmes 2  **Writer/Director**: Harry Bradbeer -Enola Holmes, Fleabag  **Cast**: Millie Bobby Brown, Henry Cavill, Helena Bohnham Carter, David Thewlis  **Plot**: Sherlock Holmes' teen sister opens her own detective agency and investigates a missing girl.  **Thoughts**: There definitely was a few cringy moments in this one. It also seems slightly more interested in romance and setting up sequels than in solving mystery. Still fast paced and enjoyable.  **Runtime**: 2h 9m   **Streaming**: Netflix  # 10. The Bob's Burgers Movie  **Writer/Director**: Loren Bouchard - Bob's Burgers, Central Park  **Cast**: H. Jon Benjamin, Kristen Schaal, Dan Mintz, John Roberts, Eugene Mirman  **Plot**: A sinkhole in front of the Belcher family's burger restaurant leads to a complicated mystery.  **Thoughts**: Pretty light on the mystery, but an easy watch especially if you are familiar with the TV show. It won't change your life, but it's a good enough way to spend a couple hours on a lazy Sunday.  **Runtime**: 1h 42m   **Streaming**: Hulu  &#x200B;  ***Honorable Mentions:***  # Only Murders in the Building - Season 2  **Creators**: John Hoffman & Steve Martin - The Jerk, Bowfinger, The Pink Panther  **Cast**: Steve Martin, Martin Short, Selena Gomez, Tina Fey, Cara Delevingne  **Plot**: The murders keep on piling up as a second murder requires the trio to continue their podcast.  **Thoughts**: Hard to recommend to watch if you haven't seen the first season, but if Whodunits are your thing, then watch that too. Martin and Short crush it, and the mysteries are really well constructed.  **Runtime**: 5h 37m   **Streaming**: Hulu  # The Afterparty  **Creator**: Christopher Miller - 21/22 Jump Street, The Lego Movie, Clone High  **Cast**: Sam Richardson, Tiffany Haddish, Ben Schwartz, Zoe Chao, Ike Barinholtz  **Plot**: After a high school reunion, friends all go to the after party of a now famous classmate.  **Thoughts**:  Great show to binge in a single afternoon. Each episode is from a different POV . They experiment with a few genres which doesn't always work, it had me guessing until the end.  **Runtime**: 3h 56m   **Streaming**: Apple TV+"

Hmm, good cast, director, many Reddit opinions, I added this film to my watchlist and it sat there for a long time.  I have now just watched this film.  Wow.  This was a banger, an “epic” in the true sense.  Orlando Bloom plays Balian, who after the loss of his wife, finds his seeking out redemption in Jerusalem and the politics that lie there. He learns what it means to be a knight.  I was expecting a lopsided depiction of events, as Hollywood does as usual. But I thought Ridley Scott did a fair job in displaying this historical event, from all sides. There were some issues/critiques of course, but I can respect the effort Ridley Scott made. It's only a shame that there are not more epic films made like this: powerful, moving, grandiose, large action, meaningful, spiritual, historical, well acted, shot and soundtracked.  Despite any flaws, this film was a 10/10 for me because of the art of filmmaking that went into this movie. The details and precision could be felt. It had a meaningful journey that was depicted really well, the writing/dialogue was superb."

The storyline is packed with super non-toxic, sex positive vibes blended with demographic stereotypes. It's a very short and “nothing new” story in actuality, but it was produced in most ideal manner. I loved the animation style and artwork particularly. They captured New York City exactly the way the city is, stunts and actions exaggerated like anime, vibrant colors and effects. It's also has a lot of romance which I was really enjoying. I loved how Timothee Chalamet and Ty Dolla $ign had such subtle and awesome roles. The music was perfect for all applicable scenes. In my opinion, everyone from NYC and probably couples should watch this movie together. It's a great date night movie. I also think I would enjoy rewatching this too."

Is it as simple as they were hiding the whole time?   Also, after finishing the film and finding out about the whole luring women in stuff, it makes sense in my eyes that they would've tried to kill Frank had he not been infected. Due to him having a daughter, and looking quite strong. Probably someone the army folk wouldn't like to mess with as they'd know he'd intervene with their plans sooner than Jim.  \\- 2 questions, why do the soldiers only come out when Frank is infected? And would they have killed Frank had he not been infected there at the checkpoint/later on?  Sorry this was a long clutter of text for 2 simple questions, I just enjoyed the film very much"

But the whole thing about gifts, and getting new toys, I'm all about that. St. Nicholas was real after all.  As a child, I grew up with Rudolph, Michael Caine as Scrooge, Frosty (and NOT Frosty returns, despite what CBS has told you since 1992, that is NOT the sequel), Jingle all the Way.  But there is one movie I am grateful my childhood stayed away from…  Why do I hate “A Christmas Story?”  - It's a movie from the 80s set in the 40s. F. Right there. Keeping the film set in contemporary times would have really helped. Especially with commercialism boom. If Ralphie's big toy still needed to be a pellet gun, that's fine. Kids of the 80s played with those. - That stupid rabbit suit, that Stupid lamp, that stupid tongue freezing pole. All the subplots are dumb and at nothing to the “Christmas Story.” - I hate this movie so much. The “Story” during Christmas time is just awful and if Ralphie is supposed to be learning a lesson, he isn't. “You will shoot you eye out” is repeated every ten minute to not only Ralphie, but to us. IT WONT STOP. Ralphie imagines it, it happens in reality. Every chance Ralphie tries to speak he is answered by the same tired line… and I wouldn't have cared that much if RALPHIE WAS LEARNING A LESSON. But nope. After being told “No” and “You'll Shoot your eye out” more times than is appropriate to a child during WW2, Ralphie STILL GETS THE BB GUN. And what does he do? RECOIL SHOOT NEAR HIS EYE AND BREAK HIS GLASSES.  Wish Ralphie instead shot at the Bunny suit or the Leg Lamp."

It was probably true, it doesn't take away from the fact she was the best in her day, being the 1930s and 40s.   When Bette Davis didn't say anything, and her face was how she expressed her emotions, she was incredible. In BORDERTOWN, she depicts her character's increasing insanity in the most subtle way possible. An entire sequence devoted to her worrying face and she nails it.   In IN THIS OUR LIFE, she plays a Southern Belle who steals her sister's husband and turns to murder when her spoiled whims never satisfy her. A scene of her running from the cops and glancing at her rearview mirror, it's the best kind of acting I've seen in Film.   When Bette Davis came to the scene, nobody was like her. Actresses wanted to be pretty and never wanted to play villains. Bette Davis embraced challenging parts, she wanted to act and the more difficult a role was, the more she wanted it. Her performance in OF HUMAN BONDAGE was groundbreaking, it was the part of a tramp destroyed by her selfishness and later, syphylis. Nobody wanted to play the part of Mildred Rogers, Bette Davis took it and it changed everything for her."

Professionals and general audiences a like are not looking at it as fondly as before. Sure, it's still considered a watchable sequel unlike...the third movie.  BUT, it's clear that it's reception has declined over the decades, even to the point where some stations will skip it and play 3 after 1 (because 3 interests people to view to see how bad it is with all the complaints about .)  **What about you? How has Beverly Hills Cop 2 aged for you?**  Imo, BHC2 has a few jokes that were cringe then that seem a bit more now, and the plot holes are more hilarious now with the whole alphabet killing stuff and them trying (and failing) to tie all the lose ends of the story together by the end.

Idk, just took me out of it!  Anyone else?"

There has been an influx of these movies recently and wondered what ones seem to capture either the seedy Hollywood industry practices or Harvey history.  For me I reckon The Assistant makes a strong contender for getting the unnerving feeling how awful and powerless one would feel in those circumstances. It is a very slow burn of a movie and I can see why it'd be a turn off for a lot of people.  Also what is the general consensus of the movie She Said?"

I couldn't tell you much about it. But what I remember very clearly is minutes after the movie was complete, I got a phone call from a blocked number. A prerecorded message played saying The Interview had been banned in the US and I was going to be prosecuted. They said I could leave a brief defense on a voicemail and then a beep occurred. I muttered something about it being in Neflix and hung up.   Not a soul knew I was watching that movie. I called Neflix, told them what happened and asked if it was a gimmick. The person on the phone was confused and said it wasn't illegal and they didn't release the streaming data of their customers.  I hope this is allowed by the Mods. Please let me know if anyone else experienced this. I have brought it up before to people I know and they think I'm making it up. I can't find anything about it on the internet."

        "body": "(This was my first time ever watching this movie, Im curious what ya'll think about it too :) ) [SPOILERS for a film that came out in 1982]    Blade Runner: The Final Cut is a very Dystopian-Noir futuristic film, featuring Harrison Ford as the main character, Decker, who is a retired LAPD Officer tasked with finding 4 “Replicants” to execute them for their crimes against humanity. Going into this film, I expected it to be a much more solemn, slower, melancholic story, but to my surprise I was wrong. I guess that's on me, since I should have known it would be more action-packed since Harrison Ford plays the main character. A few points I want to talk about in the film, which I think are important to discuss, are as follows:  The Acting The Action The Directing/Choices of the Director  Lets start with #1, the Acting. For a film with one of its core concepts being “Replicants” that are supposed to be “More Human than Human”, they don't seem to fit in at all with the society that is portrayed in the film. The “Replicants” who are just Synthetic Humans, their whole purpose is to blend into society, but they do the exact opposite. Evade people's personal space, talk in weird fashions, stare at people for abnormal amounts of time, and overall weird behavioral tendencies that no human should have. But, I realized that that's the whole point of the Replicants. They only have 4 years to live, and near the end of their lifespan, they start to develop actual emotions. Fear, Hate, Love, etc… you know the drift. The whole reason they were acting weird in the first place was because they realized that they weren't human and were slowly realizing that they were dying. It makes a lot more sense when you think of it like that, and it holds a lot more depth and understanding to the story and characters. That is good writing, if I do say so myself.  Now onto #2, The Action. The action segments in this movie aren't too far in between, so it's not boring in any way shape or form. The thing about it, is that its brutally gruesome in certain segments. (SPOILER WARNING) There are 4 Replicants on the loose. Rachel, Leon, Pris, and Roy. Skipping forward near the end of the film, Decker heads into Sebastian's apartment, to only find nothing but toys and disgusting abominations. This leads to Decker finding Pris (a “Pleasure” bot) and shoots her in the stomach as she is back flipping over him. She squirms on the floor and screams loudly, before Decker shoots her again. Her screams and squirms get louder before she inevitably stops and dies. The very next scene is Roy (the last Replicant that Decker kills) coming up on the Elevator and finding that Decker killed Pris. Roy tells Decker that she was nearing the end of her lifespan, and they were trying to find a way to live forever. Which went out the window, when Roy killed both Sebastian and Tyrell, the genius which created the Replicants in the first place by poking his eyes out. Roy and Decker have a long-ish cat and mouse fight, before they end up on the rooftops. Decker tries to scale the building and jump to the next one, but barely hangs on by his 8 fingers since Roy broke the other 2 in their fight. Decker is about to fall off the building, but Roy saves him from his impending doom. They have a little talk about the Replicants and having to feel emotions. This is a very profound scene in the large action segment, with Roy explaining that he wanted to show Decker, a human, what its like for a Replicant to feel that same feeling every single day until their eventual “retirement”. Roy shows his last bit of humanity as he powers down and dies in front of Decker, showing that not only are all Replicants bad, per say, but they are also human as well, in a metaphorical sense. That is just so… profound.  And finally #3, The Direction. Ridley Scott, the director of this movie, has done more than just Blade Runner: The Final Cut. He has done the classic “Alien” and many more. Specifically, we are going to be looking at those 2 that I mentioned, since they came out around the same time. Those 2 movies have some similarities and differences, the obvious one I wanted to point out was the use of Technology. The film is set in 2019 Los Angeles, aside from the flying cars and laser pistols, the Technology is sorta… *dated*. Although this may seem like a bit picky thing to complain about, I'm not complaining. In fact, this choice from Ridley Scott Revolutionized the entire Sci-Fi Genre as we know it. I'm both Alien and Blade Runner: The Final Cut, there are many scenes with extremely old computers, with basic grids and can only do basic functions. But, the functions they carry out in the films are extraordinary for their time. For example, there is a scene in Blade Runner where Decker enhances a photo a couple times, speaking to the computer how many grid spots it moves, where to center the camera, telling the computer to pan to the left or right, enhancing the quality, etc… all things that you more than likely couldn't do on an old Macintosh-style computer from the early 80's. Both movies use this style of technology for the “future” settings, using what little they had at the time and enhancing it through editing or what have you. This is what I call, Oxymoronic Analog Technology, or OAT for short. Using *old* technology with *new* enhancements and functions, making it seem futuristic. Ridley Scott might have not come up with the OAT Concept, but he for sure made it a staple in 2 of the most revolutionary Sci-Fi Films of the 20th Century, changing the entire course of the Sci-Fi Film Genre as we know it.  So even if it is a film about Harrison Ford murdering Synthetic Humans, at the end of the day it's a revolutionary film that deserves its recognition as one of the forefathers of the Sci-Fi Genre and so does Ridley Scott as well."

Some movies were contractually obligated to make a sequel or lose money. 3. Some studios get lazy on the 3rd installment and make a subpar movie compared to the first 2. (ie. The Godfather 1 & 2, The Terminator 1 & 2, TMNT 1&2 They all had 2 great first installments but the third felt forced or unnecessarily lazy.)  Also they just made a sequel to RIPD which was a horrible train wreck and no one asked for a sequel. Seems like a contractual obligation movies to me so they wouldn't lose more money or whatever."

The owner / operator of the theatre must know GDT because he set up a zoom meeting after the screening and just 1:1 interviewed him right there! They projected the zoom meeting on screen and we got to listen in on what felt like a really close and personal interview.   The dude is so cool. His history with making films, his passion for storytelling and stop-motion in particular (having started in stop motion), his down to earth perspective. He's the kind of filmmaker that just makes going to the movies the best. Even spoke a bit about Cabinet of Curiosities, too!   'Pinocchio,' was just something else. Beautiful, deeply emotional story. Some incredible stop motion animation. A completely new take on Pinocchio's story. One thing that surprised me—it's really funny too! Some great VA performances from a star-studded cast. Just so much to love. It is definitely a more mature film than other executions, but not necessarily inappropriate for older kids.  If you get the chance to see it in theaters I really recommend it. So much love went into making this thing, it was just fantastic.  Anyways, thought I'd share about that cool moviegoing experience. Check it out."

Sometimes a story wants to be set in a dream — not just to use surreal imagery or 'dream-logic,' but to actually be set inside one or more interconnected dreams within the text of the narrative.   *Inception* is the classic example of a movie that says it's going to do this and never actually bothers — that movie feels like it's set in a series of rather logical interconnected video game levels, with our only concession to the 'dream' concept being some pilfered Satoshi Kon imagery and a scene where a cityscape goes foldy-foldy. This is not a query about *Inception.*  My two live-action visual touchstones for stories set in dreams are *Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind*, particularly the last third, and the Buffy episode *Restless.* These are not only set largely in dreams within the narrative and progress using some amount of 'dream-logic,' but also go to some lengths to achieve the texture and dizzying 'feel' of being in a dream.   Because I don't know shit about fuck, and am not as ciné-literate as I should be… what are some other examples that you think are as good or better? They should be 1) live action, 2) explicitly set in a dream within the narrative, and 3) really try to *feel* like dreams to match their narrative pretensions.

Also, Michael Caine's role is such an oddity, he's just there to be a love interest.   I actually didn't mind the other characters. I appreciated that this movie focused more on the human story instead of it just being shark vs humans. And they did cast good actors like Karen Young and Mario Van Peebles and Judith Barsi.

        "body": "The following are recalled from memory and factual errors are expected.  I am familiar to the fan theory that the 1996 film, The Rock, was a homage to the Bond films. I have read two separate publications, that once their information were to be pieced together eventually convinced me that The Rock was secretly a Bond fan film by people who love and adore Sean Connery and the James Bond films without in any way shape or form infringed on the intellectual property rights of Eon Productions.  Regardless of the lie or truth, I have enjoyed the films.  Years pass and the 2021 film, No Time To Die was finally released. I made sure to not to be spoiled and came to watch the movie with a fresh mind.  **Important!** Spoilers bellow to those who have not seen the movie *No Time To Die*. You have been **warned**!    There I was enjoying the movie. Somewhere at the first third of the movie, an old memory was suddenly recalled. I found the scene I was watching started to become familiar.  It was only a few minutes later and I realized that it was not the scene but the actors acting that reminded me of the characteristics of the characters that were played by Nicolas Cage and Sean Connery in the 1996 film, The Rock. In the next seconds, the boat sank.  I continued to watch and had a fun thought that the character played by Billy Magnussen was secretly or some sort of a homage to the character played by Nicolas Cage. But that can't be. That would be a legal problem. I then recalled that Daniel Craig always talked how extremely difficult it was to finally find a good script with what was to be his last run as James Bond. There was a lot of pressure and anticipation of a high quality script that made everyone satisfied. It would be crazy if they plagiarized another intellectual property, they only had the books and past films for inspirations.  As the movie progressed, I could not help but suspect the movie more and more. The next suspicion was the final meeting between James Bond and the character played by Billy Magnussen. The character was smiling and the way he was laughing and as his character was trapped and under the cross-hairs of James Bond. An American agent, smiling, that laugh, under orders, and a big fan of James Bond. Those describe almost accurately the character played by Nicolas Cage and how Sean Connery's character grated under the antics and behavior of Nicolas Cage's character.  There was no way this was possible, but the similarities did not end there. This also severely distracted me from enjoying the movie.  There was the daughter, the poison, the island, the concrete interior scenes, the action, the monologues, the eventual sacrifice, the lone character in black walking out to the open on top of a concrete structure, the signal, the fighter jets flying over, the very explosive bombs to neutralize the poison, the motivation of James Bond, and many more.  The explosions definitely reminded me of the over-the-top explosions usually found in the films of Jerry Bruckheimer and Michael Bay... The Rock was produced by Jerry Bruckheimer and directed by Michael Bay.  This speculation is crazy. Just the legal ramifications alone... But both rights holders are not suing each other even with a lot of evidence.  There is a precedent where something like this happened before. Dave Chappelle had a TV show, and one skit was about a true story of the musician known or formally known as Prince, basketball, and pancakes. Dave Chappelle and his team were worried by any legal reaction from Prince when the episode was released. There was none. Sometime later, Prince released an album, with the cover of a picture of Dave Chappelle dressed as Prince holding pancakes. Dave Chappelle did not sue Prince, just as Prince did not sue Dave Chappelle.  Thank you for reading."

It's well acted but it just comes off as all Allen's style without much of the substance that usually makes his movies really good. I will say it's well acted, has some funny lines, and I did like Allen and Wiest's characters plots but I just couldn't get that interested in Caine's plot or Farrow's plot.   If it had focused entirely on Wiest and Allen, their characters, and their romance I might've enjoyed it.

John himself stated the motivation behind this was the money he could make from SELLING this jet. !<  >!I just find it interesting so far in a 4 part series, we still don't know what John did with his life (by the documentary, he seems to be pretty basic).

Of course this is years later, when it came out I saw most people praising it.  For years I have not watched any disney movies, not seen many since I have been a child. But in the last few weeks I have gone through most of the popular recent releases. And some of them have been to my surprise quite enjoyable. For example, I watched Luca and Coco and moana, I really quite enjoyed Luca. Coco was fine too. ALl of those were much better to me than Frozen. If someone had told me that frozen was done by some b-tier animation studio and not disney, I would have believed it. But I would have not believed that as easily with moana, Luca, or Coco. Even just the animation in those was much better, well not the animation per say, but the scenery and beauty. It takes a lot less work to create landscapes full of mostly one color, snow, than the scenery we see in those movies. Especially Moana and Coco  But then I got to watching Frozen. It felt like a very basic movie. Like it did not feel like there was anything surprising or new happening. The plot in itself felt very dull. Like the kid runs away from home due to the magic being out of control, the sister goes looking for her, finds her, gets thrown out. The bad guys go looking for her, there is a fight, she is captured and she is brought back to home, the other sister goes back to home, love saves the day. The parts where there is travel from one place to another lacked anything interesting happening. Like Elsa just goes somewhere we get a few scenes of her travelling the next time we see her she is in a castle she built.  Now, I thought that the majority of the popularity was from young kids, especially young girls. Since I can see this kind of a story with two female leads as being something they would enjoy seeing, and that has to be a part of it. But then I asked my mother if she had seen the movie and she said yes and that she liked it. Then I asked if she has seen Luca and she said is and that it was shit. I asked what she liked about frozen and she said the snowman is funny.  But even the comedy that the snowman gives is in my opinion not nearly as great as other comedy characters in other disney movies. Like the Donkey in shrek. It was all in all just completely forgettable and not interesting at all.  Now, I have nothing against anyone who does like the movie, kids or adults, its just something I can not relate to liking, apart from it being liked by a young girl that likes the princess theme."

Watching it made me go, Oh yeah people used to do stunts in real life and I almost forgot, they're incredibly awesome.   And I gotta say, there's quite a cultural flair to them, too. The way the protagonist rolls around the roof of a vehicle to dodge oncoming cars makes him look like a damn ninja, and makes you wonder why we gave this up for green-screened laser battles.

        "body": "I'm a 33 year old stay at home father. I've seen bits and pieces of this movie like 300 times by now because my young daughter watches it two or three times a day and now I've finally seen the whole thing straight through. This is what gets me- it's insanely popular for all the wrong reasons and totally misunderstood by most of the kids who I've heard from.  First of all, both of these two girls are obviously best friends as young girls. Since their parents are woefully inept they shut their one child(Elsa) away instead of trying to get her to learn how to control herself. This turns her into a neurotic, agoraphobic, paranoid, mean-spirited shut-in after their untimely death. This in turn causes their other child(Anna) to become a desperately attention-seeking, manic, impulsive, socially awkward mess of a woman who quite literally decides to marry the very first man she bumps into- Hans.  So Coronation Day comes along and Elsa is forced to leave her self imposed prison for The First Time in Forever. The two seem to get along well enough until Anna and her new boyfriend show up to ask for Elsa's blessing on their marriage. Elsa refuses. After years of being denied by her sister over and over Anna lashes out. This causes a chain reaction which exposes Elsa's powers to the world. Elsa does what she is used to doing and runs away from her problems again and embraces a life of solitude in an ice palace on a mountain top.  Anna sets off on her own to save her sister because she blames herself for everything that's gone wrong. Again, she latches onto the first person she meets. This is where her arc begins to turn. Anna starts to display more strength and independence than we've seen thus far. She's standoffish with Kristoff even though she obviously needs help. She tries to do what she can on her own but he and Olaf(and Sven) are integral in helping her become the hero she needs to be. Kristoff is content in letting her fail in climbing the mountain while Olaf finds the stairs the foursome need to reach Elsa. This helps to teach her to remain humble even though she thinks she can do it all alone.  After being shunned once more by her sister and chased away by Olaf's giant cousin Marshmallow Anna finally displays real courage and heroism when she saves Kristoff as he's falling down the mountain. I believe this is the point where Anna realizes that she actually does have the inner strength she needs to save her sister.  Alright, so fast forward to the finale- “An act of true love will save you” and Hans is actually a douchebag all along.  As Anna, Kristoff, Elsa and Hans are all wandering through the blizzard looking for one another we see Anna look toward Kristoff. He calls to her but she sees Hans about to attack her sister and turns away. She uses the last of her strength to shield her sister from Hans' sword just as she freezes solid. It seems to us that she has sacrificed receiving a kiss from her actual true love that might have saved her life to save her sister instead. Elsa turns and sees Anna and hugs her and begins to weep.  This is where my kids and many others get lost. Every time Else hugs Anna and begins to cry my little girl cries out, “She saved her! She loves her!” She thinks Elsa finally showing her sister that she cares about her is what unfreezes Anna.  No. Damn it, no.  Anna could have gone to Kristoff but instead she sacrificed herself to save her sister. That is the act of true love that unfroze her heart. Anna saved herself. Anna saved Elsa. Anna saved Arendelle. Anna is the hero. She even gets to deck Hans off the boat at the end.  You know what I saw when Halloween rolled around this year? About 1,000 Elsa's. You want to guess how many Anna's I saw? Zero. Take a stab at who my daughter likes to dress up as? Yup, Elsa. Walk through Walmart and check out the Frozen merchandise. Elsa is everywhere and Anna and the others play second fiddle. I just don't get it. I know that Disney can't help which characters the kids fall in love with but I can't help but be frustrated that the message just didn't come across. You have two children from a broken home with serious issues and one sister was strong enough to overcome and help them both to heal and become relatively normal and somehow everyone idolizes the screwed up one who just ran away and hid from everyone.  Sigh.  Yes, I realize that kids love the magical one and that children also gravitate toward the classic Disney Princess type character and Elsa is both of these things. I almost wish that Disney had made Elsa a little more wicked and ugly so that the main theme and lessons shone through a little more, that's all. Anna's transformation seems largely overlooked and I think that's kind of a shame because it's a well done movie.  So, why do I want to build a snowman? Because Olaf is freaking awesome. Say what you like about the themes and messages throughout the rest of the film- Disney knows how to write comic relief. I love everything about Olaf from him calling Kristoff Sven for quite awhile to Grab my butt. His character is just great and extremely well written and comedically timed. I think I could watch a whole Olaf standalone film.  I don't know if this is a review or a rant or what and I'm sure most if not all of you who've seen this film understood everything I've written here already but this movie has been playing nearly nonstop in my house for weeks now and I just had to get this out. I hope someone enjoyed reading it.  Thanks.  Tl;Dr: Elsa is a wreck, Anna is the true hero, the kids don't care and Olaf is the shit."

        "index": "0   1     2    3       4      5   6   ",
        "body": " Have you ever finished a great video game and went “wow, I wish they made a movie out of this”. If so, you are not alone, many successful video game franchises have been adapted into movies and few of them turned out well…Hardly few. Why video game sourced movies are always received terribly? What makes book sourced movies so good, let's go deeper into this rabbit hole and see why this collaboration is challenging.  Movies are for viewing, Gaming is for experience  First off, movie viewing is a simple experience where you just sit in the comforts of your home or theaters and consume what is being shown to you, video games on the other hand, are interactive by nature, The players are involved with the game in every step of the way, they make decisions for their character, they suffer the consequences of their actions, they actively explore the world and everything it has to offer, it's a unique immersive experience, that's why they are so enjoyable. Meanwhile, you can only view movies.    RPG genre offers the best immersion in this case, you are playing as the character and are following their journey in their shoes, since they are so captivating they demand a lot of attention and time to finish it, this is the biggest hurdle a film maker has to overcome. To reduce the 40+ hours of immersive game play into a 2 hour movie, this task is very herculean, even if it is carried out successfully a lot of the source material has to be eliminated, this is bound for failure in the eyes of hardcore fans, this results in nothing but a hollow shell most of the times. Story rich games with huge lore and world building behind them are often victims of this, these games are held to a higher standard, so they fail to meet expectations with the fans.  The Way of telling stories is completely different  The scripts of video games and movies are totally different, video game story scripts are made by keeping in mind the interactive aspect and the various choices the player can have, the film makers can't just replicate this kind of script or story board for the movies, the source material here can't be directly transferred without eliminating the video game aspects. But book adaptations don't face this fate as they are similar to movies where there is no interaction involved, the path is quite linear unlike video games where the trajectory is variable.  “One more thing which has to be considered by the film producers are the audience, movies have to be made with the fact that some of the audience may not be acquainted with the video game alternative.”  A non gamer will not know anything about the lore, the history or any other literary aspect of the game when they watch the movie, so to tailor the movie to them is a challenge, can you imagine? Bombarding a viewer with the entire back story of a game which takes a couple of hours into a small time frame? If you did, you'll know how many details you'll have to skip out and this leaves just a skeletal overview with no soul.   AAA titles normally have a lot of sequels and prequels which is just more information to process and compress for the writers. And of course if they plan to make a movie franchise of the same with multiple installments, there are lots of risks mainly the monetary aspect and scheduling multiple movies when you don't know if the first installment of the movie will be received well or not. So producers go for the least risky route where they don't have to suffer much losses and try to wrap up the entire game in a single movie and see how it will be received, depending on the reception, they may green light multiple installments of the movie. This is a conflict of profit and storytelling.  Even the ways they are made is totally different, the only common factor they have is the immense computing power which is required, movies with tremendous graphics need lot of rendering time to attain the final product which takes forever with unless a large number of computers are put to work, whereas games follow real time rendering where the models are rendered while you play the game which is dependent on your hardware, Depending on the quality of the product, larger staff has to be assembled.  Instead, this is being done and it is good   One thing which successful adaptations have done is adapting the video game into a TV show where aren't bound by the constraints of time, which will allow them the time to flesh out the world and develop the characters over the span of the season and can stay as close as to the source as much as possible, The Castlevania series is a good example of this kind of production. Video game graphics adapted into live action gives the viewer a “something is not right here” kind of feel. The first impression is kind of thrown over, Even though CGI has advanced, an animated form of story telling the video game has its charm, Arcane (adapted from league of legends) and Cyberpunk Edgerunners (adapted from Cyberpunk 2077) have pulled out the best video game adaptations into TV shows by animated forms, Arguably the pinnacle of video game adaptations. Adapting only the world and lore and creating new characters which aren't pressured to follow the developments in the game is an interesting technique some studios have adapted, Pokemon is the best example of this kind of adaptation.  Compromises must be made  I would like to end this by saying that a faithful adaptation which lot of fans seek with all aspects covered is a near impossible for a movie to cover, the mediums diverge too much, the best alternative one can see of a video game adaptation is in the form of a TV series with an animated medium, some compromises have to be accepted, they are different mediums for a reason"

However, there were many times when I kept thinking it would have been better if it had become a miniseries rather than a film. Certain points and switches during the film felt like they would have been stellar cliffhangers onto the end of episodes and given the ensemble a show version could have gone deeply into all their backstories rather than truncating them as much as possible.   I know the pacing and piecing together is a big complaint of the film, and it sucks, because I think the potential is well and truly there, but would have benefitted greatly from a longer format. Getting to know each of those characters more intimately, and being taken on all those journeys could have made for a wild ride and made the ending more impactful. Just my 2 cents as this was my main thought I took away from it by the end."

Walter's Evelyn is obsessive, suicidal and psychotic and she doesn't have Close's feminist rants about being used by a man as a woman. In Evelyn's mind, Eastwood's character is the love of her life and if he can't love her, then she'll hack him not only to death but also his ex, played by a surprisingly plain Donna MIlls (guess she only started doing glamour later on) , and his maid.

The items are mainly ugly burgers with names like, The Claudia Cardinale etc. But I also have made Chicken-Fried Chicken Parmesan and also made up new recipes from scratch like Slow Armadillo, a deep-fried jalapeño pepper stuffed with goat cheese and wrapped in bacon.

You all need to watch it.   Jamin Winans - the city surf   Here's a synopsis .  Dan of Geek  Ink's plot is an intriguing, enigmatic mixture of Snow White, Alice In Wonderland and A Christmas Carol. We're introduced to John (Chris Kelly) a wealthy businessman who's addicted to drink, drugs and making huge sums of money, to the exclusion of his wife and young daughter, Emma.  Against this backdrop, an unseen war plays out between the angelic Storytellers, who bring us pleasant dreams while we sleep, and the evil Incubi, who terrorise us with nightmares. It's a battle that has gone on for eternity, it seems, while the rest of us have all been tucked up in bed. Then, one night, a grotesque, gargoyle-like figure named Ink arrives at the foot of Emma's bed, and in spite of the Storytellers' fighting skills, manages to spirit her away to another plane of reality.   Whatever Ink's influences may be, it's an often stunning-looking film, shot and edited with a skill that far outweighs its tiny budget. Its antagonists, the Incubi, are weird and perfectly unsettling. Its music (also written by Winans) is subtle and effective."

The film is powerful enough to rile up the same emotions felt around the world in the times following Kennedy's assassination, and for its messages about trust in government I would consider it a movie important enough that should be seen by everybody.

It focused on a mission-oriented individual with few relationships and an aversion to working with others. The magic of the movie was seeing this character grow by joining others to accomplish shared goals and watching the individual's outlook change in consideration of the group. I'm a sucker for team movie, and this was a good one.  There were plenty of laughs.  Fears were overcome. A team coming together. But, my favorite part of this movie: there was a talking cat.

A character that would easily be way over the top or underwhelming, if it were not for Hanks walking that tight rope perfectly. Easily one of the most memorable characters in cinema history.   In Cast Away we see Tom play a man who DOES have that urge to control everything. His arc of losing that urge and slowly realizing he can not control anything is beautifully done. The realistic look he gives us into the breaking mind of someone who is stuck on an island for 4 years is special. Nevermind the physical lengths Hanks went to for this role, losing 55 lbs.

For most movies, however good, the intense feeling from it typically goes away after having a good night's sleep in my case, but this movie continues to grab me hard even as I'm writing this. So anyway, since it was my first time watching it and I don't dare to revisit the movie just now, I have to ask you guys a couple of questions.   First, what's with the scene where Jack and his wife having dinner with another couple? Is this where he meets the other man he brings to his cabin whom his father mentions to Ennis at the end? I didn't think much of it when initially watching the scene, even though there was an implication that jack and the other dude was having a some sort of connection, further highlighted by their wives' comments that their husbands don't like to dance with them.   Second, do you think there is a possibility that Jack's affair with the other fella was caught by his father-in-law and led him to be lynched to death by the townsfolks, instead of what Anne Hathaway told Ennis on the phone? I think that part was supposed to be left ambiguous but given the past trouble between him and his father-in-law and his brief remark that no one around him gets suspicious of him being queer when asked by Ennis, which could have been a foreshadowing in hindsight, I realized that the visual flashback displayed during the phone call scene might not have been just Ennis' imagination.   Third, I remember Ennis saying that he can't believe he left his shirt on the mountain right after departing from it for the first time, and later on, the same shirt is found with the blue parka in jack's room, with the same blood stain on it resulting from their fight. I didn't catch that at first but that means Jack took Ennis' shirt, unbeknownst to him, before departing the mountain, right?"

I'm an anxious person and often depressed, so this is surely a way to reassure me, to keep this moment of happiness that I knew during the first viewing. In itself, it's not a big deal but I want to get your opinion on it. It happens that I spontaneously get attached to a movie, a series, a book or a character and can stay focused on it for days. For a movie, I learn about the shooting, the actors, the meaning of the story, etc… Of course, this doesn't stop me from living my life. I then experience a form of nostalgia because I don't want to let go and I know that it will have to end.  Does this happen to you? How do you deal with it?  Concerning the film, do you advise me to restrain myself and to move on?"

        "body": "Way of the Gun is one of my favorite heist movies. I know it's been mentioned all over the internet about how underrated it is, that know one has ever heard of it and it has awesome gunplay. Also all over the internet everyone brings up how funny the opening scene is and how much they love it because Sarah Silverman gets knocked out.  One thing that has always gotten me, is the huge genre shift between the opening scene and the rest of the film. It almost feels more like something out of American Pie, Road Trip or Dude Where's My Car rather than something out of a serious and cynical heist movie.  This movie did come out in 2000 and because of American Pie's success in 1999, there was a huge wave of American Pie clones and knock offs, often using the same actors. These included the above mentioned Road Trip, Dude Where's my Car as well as Tom Cats, Van Wilder, Loser (aka Teenage Dirtbag the movie), etc.  Anyway, I almost feel like with the opening scene you could easily keep Sarah Silverman, replace her boyfriend in the scene with Seann William Scott replace Ryan Phillippe and Benicio Del Toro with Jason Biggs and Breckin Meyer and you easily have the opening to an early 2000s college age sex comedy. I can easily hear Seann William Scott saying Wanna do the man dance? First dance is yours! and just chewing the scenery a little bit. While Breckin Meyer attempts to act tough and punch Silverman and then him and Biggs get their asses handed to them.  The opening scene is such a huge contrast to the rest of the film which is a very smart, cleaver and highly cynical kidnapping/heist movie. The film has Sam Peckinpah and William Friedkin written all over it. I know Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid is supposed to be the main influence (due to the two leads names) but the film feels closer to The Wild Bunch, The Getaway and Sorcerer in terms of tone/themes.  The action scenes are very smart, I know the ending shootout at the brothel gets praised a lot and it's one of the best I've seen but my favorite is the slow speed car chase. One of the smartest I have ever seen in a movie!"

Appreciate it's a pretty broad category given what i've essentially described is a bog standard bildungsroman trope.

WAY more interesting than two teenagers blandly complimenting each other while everyone else does the work around them.''  That makes me wonder - what other short stories told or briefly shown within a movie were more interesting than the whole plot?   One from myself -   I remember a cartoon I watched as a kid - The Swan Princess. It starts with two rulers uniting their kingdoms by agreeing to marry their heirs. So the first 6 minutes are of a Prince and Princess spending each summer together and going from hating to love each other. After that, it becomes just a generic story (I say that because I watched this movie a lot when I was small but remember absolutely nothing, except the first 6 minutes). Would've been better if they just made a whole movie of them two growing up and seeing more of them through time periods."

        "body": "Direct-to-video films:  - Tom and Jerry: The Magic Ring (2001) **8.5/10, highly recommend** - It is my favorite Tom & Jerry film of all films. It was so fun and had some classic vibes. I liked that mansion and the new characters. It had lots of fun moments as well.   - Tom and Jerry: Blast Off to Mars (2005) **8/10, highly recommend** - I found this movie cute, enjoyable and refreshing. The animation is good, and the scenes between Tom and Jerry are so fun to watch. The aliens were fun characters, all Mars scenes are still fun. The third act where they're on Earth is also pretty good and gave me Codename: Kids Next Door vibes.  - Tom and Jerry: The Fast and the Furry (2005) **8.5/10, highly recommend** - It is the highest-rated Tom & Jerry movie on IMDb and Letterboxd. This movie touched my heart! The whole movie reminded me of Wacky Races which is also made by Joseph Barbera and William Hanna, I used to be a big fan of that cartoon series. The races were so fun and funny, I liked the new characters. I liked the jokes, everything about this movie was just great for what it is.  - Tom and Jerry: Shiver Me Whiskers (2006) **7/10, still recommend** - It was mildly enjoyable movie, I liked the colors, but I found the plot to be a bit generic though. Nothing special, except it's a solid movie though.  - Tom and Jerry: A Nutcracker Tale (2007) **7.5/10, recommend** - It's a Tom & Jerry Christmas film about a magical kingdom and living toys. And it takes only less than 50 minutes. It wasn't violent like the classic Tom & Jerry cartoons, but it was a really adorable and sweet little movie. The ending was also sweet. If you are a fan, add this on the Christmas watchlist.  - Tom and Jerry: Meet Sherlock Holmes (2010) **8/10, highly recommend** - The animation wasn't my favorite thing about this movie, but it had a lot of fun scenes. The mystery story was pleasantly fun to tell. I loved how Tom and Jerry worked well together as a team in a few scenes. I really liked the designs of London. Overall, it was really fun, and yet, it's short that takes only less than 50 minutes.  - Tom and Jerry & The Wizard of Oz (2011) **7/10. not a must-see, but still recommend** - It has exact the same plot like from The Wizard of Oz (1939), only they added Tom and Jerry. Their business is to care for Dorothy to not get hurt. The first half is good, the second half is okay. However, it was quite good.  - Tom and Jerry: Robin Hood and His Merry Mouse (2012) **4.5/10, not recommended** - The theme of Robin Hood isn't really my kind of thing to enjoy. This movie was boring with bad animations, bland humor, boring story, and had lesser Tom & Jerry scenes. And it felt a bit too long, even though it lasts less than an hour. I didn't even find any moments funny, and the scenes between Tom and Jerry were quite weak. I couldn't even care for the story or any other characters.  - Tom and Jerry's Giant Adventure (2013) **6.5/10, not a must-see** - I thought it was a cute film, and definitely better than the Robin Hood movie. I liked the story, it was fun. I also liked the little boy. The scenes between Tom and Jerry aren't really special, but there were a few funny moments between them. The animation style was pretty blah and made it feel really like it was made for only children.  - Tom and Jerry: The Lost Dragon (2014) **6.5/10, not a must-see** -  I thought the story was quite fun, but I found the colors very cheap. You could tell that every frame looks like you could paint in children's painting books.  - Tom and Jerry: Spy Quest (2015) **8/10, highly recommend** - I loved it! A refreshing, funny, and clever movie, which is quite surprising. The last few Tom and Jerry movies were so cheap, however, this one was recent and yet, much better. The animation details are amazing, I really liked the style. The side characters are amazing too, the scenes between Tom and Jerry were hilarious.  - Tom and Jerry: Back to Oz (2016) **6.5/10, not a must-see** - It's pretty much the same as Tom and Jerry & The Wizard of Oz, but worse. I don't know what else to say, I found it quite forgettable after a few hours. I don't think it was that bad, but definitely one of my least favorite Tom & Jerry movies.  - Tom and Jerry: Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory (2017) **7/10, not a must-see** - It's the lowest-rated Tom & Jerry movie to date, but I honestly don't get the hate. It was good, it had a good animation style and side characters. I found some moments strange, but I still liked it.  - Tom and Jerry: Cowboy Up! (2022) **5.5/10, not recommended** - I love the western stuff, but this one got too many musical scenes that I had to immediately speed up 2x to skip those pointless scenes. Also, the animation kinda sucked. Honestly, nothing is something special about this movie.  - Tom and Jerry: Snowman's Land (2022) **6.5/10, not a must-see** - I thought the story was actually sweet, but the background art made it too cheap. I enjoyed the scenes with Tuffy the most, and I also really liked the snowman character. I wish they did a better job with animation arts though because it was a sweet Christmas movie to watch. What surprised me is how animation improved worse over the years than usual.  Theatrical films:  - Tom and Jerry: The Movie (1992) **7/10, not a must-see** - The animation is ok, but a bit too childish. I liked all Tom and Jerry scenes together, but they were allowed to talk to each other? Whoever gave that idea wasn't a true fan of Tom & Jerry.  - Tom & Jerry (2022) **7/10, not a must-see** - Honestly not a bad movie at all. It was better than the 1992 movie. What I didn't like is the wedding stuff in the third act."

The archeologists just walk inside the mountain like you would walk into a supermarket. No troubles, no hassle, no difficulties, they just walk in and wander about inside and the crown is there.   That shitty scene got me thinking about how terrible is the writing in most of modern blockbuster movies.   It came to my mind Batman's escape from the police station in **the last Batman movie**. Like there it is, the supposedly most wanted man in Gotham and nobody makes any effort to remove the mask and then he wakes up and, still fucked up by the explosion, weak and confused, he's just able to get to the top of the building and jump and fly away and not a single policeman is able to do nothing. After watching the movie I remembered the same MC escapes from police station from the movie **Lost Bullet** and damn, that's how you do it, that's a proper scene that makes you wonder will he make it out?, where you see the character struggling and not just a scene where things happen.  *Lol, I just rememberd that Batman is inmunne to close-range machine gun fire in thise one too...*  Also another scene that actually made me laugh at the cinema, in **Black Panther** when T'Challa needs the plant to regain his powers, but Killmonger is already king and like, damn it should be difficult to retrieve the plants, if I remember correctly Killmonger wanted to destroy them all... So insted of a cool scene of sidekicks facing difficulties to retrieve the plant so T'Challa can retrieve his powers, it's just Lupita Nyong'o literally coming out of the shadows unnoticed and getting the plant and that's it, problem solved."

A single scene from a popular movie isn't iconic. Not sure if there's an agreement about what iconic is, but I'm pretty sure that word immediately throws associations in people's minds.      2- It should be known throughout the world. There are many movies that are instantly recognized by folks in the US, but take it somewhere else, and you'd get much less impact.   Now, clearly, the ET bike scene kick-started this question, but I don't think it would be my pick after some consideration. ET is a fairly known movie in the US, but I'm not sure about worldwide. I rarely met anyone outside of the US who had much renown for ET.   With that in mind, I think The Matrix bullet dodge by Neo would have to be my pick.   So, what would be your pick?"

The movie almost starts and stops without any real fanfare, almost like it's a documentary of some kind.  I guess I like how the movie lets you be a fly on the wall as this person goes through her daily struggles, some bigger than others, while seemingly in some sort of drone mode where she's moving forward in life but almost not really moving at all. It in a way reminds me of movies like Peter and the Farm and Another Year, where you sort of just observe what's going on even though nothing is really going on.

He got a small window to get rid of it, which he did by sliding sideways so close to a little cement post that this little hockey puck (which he couldn't even see, and only had a rough idea of its location) clipped and flew off, but his car didn't even make contact.   I think it would have been a much better moment if he actually put a dent and a bunch of scratches on it. All cosmetic, obviously, but it would have made the yeah, right... moment a oh man, he did it! moment. It would have made the unbelieavable totally believable and impressive. He still would have gotten rid of the puck thing, he still would have kept driving, it still would have been impressive because it takes skill to do anyway, and it would have been much more realistic and human to manage to do such a cool thing in a plausible way, which would have made it much much better."

Michael is worried about his father's safety after the assassination attempt, and rightly so, as more goons are en route. Luckily, Enzo the baker shows up to pay his respects, and Michael enlists him to bluff the carload of goons by standing out front with a posture that suggests they're armed.  The detail I like so much happens after they successfully bluff the goons, who drive off after eyeing Enzo and Michael. Once the goons are gone, Enzo fumbles out a cigarette, unable to light it because his hands are shaking so badly.  But not Michael's. He lights Enzo's cigarette with cool, steady hands, and pauses for a moment as if to take note of this. That he's seen action in war is no guarantee he's got steady hands; in fact, trauma would possibly have the opposite effect. So he may very well have surprised himself. Either way, it's one of those great little touches that illustrate Michael's character, and foreshadow his capability to one day lead the family.  Love it. Great movie, great little detail that speaks volumes about Michael."

It's a lesser version of the climax from the last one, but it's sort of like that mixed with The Raid, which is kinda cool.  It's big and loud, everyone has something interesting to do, and if nothing else, it gives us footage of Arnold Schwarzenegger mowing down a bunch of guys in a chopper manned by actual pilot Harrison Ford. That's pretty awesome.  I think the second one of these is the only one that delivers enough on the premise to be considered worthwhile, but the other ones do have their moments, and I will be interested to see the fourth one when it comes out.

        "body": "I've heard that most movies are shot in film order, that is, the scenes are filmed in mostly the same order that they will appear in the final film.  This is done to give the actors a sense of continuity, to help with their performances.  Some low-budget films are shot out of order, since the shooting schedule is built around the availability of locations, or sometimes even the cast and crew.  But for the most part, it's shot in the order you see on screen.  This is even true for movies with frequent flashbacks, or multiple timelines.  Even if something takes place long before or long after the rest of the action, it's shot at the point where it will appear in the final film.  This sometimes necessitates redressing a set (and taking careful notes so it can be reset afterwards) or giving certain actors the day off, since their characters' younger or older selves are played by different actors.  My question is, are there any films which filmed the scenes in the chronological order they took place, within the context of the story?  For example, if HBO's *Chernobyl* was shot this way, >!their first day of filming would be the prologue in Bryukhanov's office at the beginning of Episode 5.  Next they would shoot the reactor scenes, starting with the flashbacks in the courtroom, and then the sequence from the beginning of Episode 1.  After that they would shoot the rest of Ep. 1, and then Eps. 2, 3, and 4 in roughly the order they appear in the series.  Finally, they would shoot the non-flashback courtroom scene, and then the very last day would be Legasov's suicide from the very beginning of Episode 1.!<  Are there any notable films or TV series that were shot this way?"

That is the best feature of the film. Am I the only one who is driven crazy by horror fans such as this? Why is Jaws so great? It's bc you don't see the shark for 1.5 hours into the movie. Whatever horror is in your head is scarier than what you see. The Blair Witch Project is disrespected by a bunch of simple, narrow-minded nerds who don't understand film making. Change my mind."

It shows how much horror the German soldiers in word war 1 had to go through, how much fear and grief they had seeing people they knew die, and the mental effect of killing someone had on the characters. I've watched this in class for school.  This movie isn't shy of violence at all, probably the most violent war movie I've seen. But the violence is what makes this movie special. It doesn't glorify it, it's hard to watch most of the time. I believe all war movies should do this, because war is always painted like something like a field of dandelions, but it's a bleak reality, of soldiers that have families. The characters in the movie understand that killing an enemy will result in killing a father, or husband. This makes the movie perfect, makes you feel bad for all sides.  The movie also transfers from the book extremely well also.  All and all, movie 10/10, definitely watch if you aren't afraid of heavy violence and gore, and if you can, read the book."

I agree, the premise is her reminiscing of better times, but I don't feel like he committed suicide in the end.   I would interpret the scene of him crying on the edge of the bed as him feeling guilt for not being there enough for her growing up. Maybe him being in London meant that he stopped seeing her, possibly let her down a lot. Maybe she gave up on him.  I think the airport scene at the end is a representation of the final time they had good memories together.   Anyway, clearly my reasoning for this viewpoint is very personal, but I just wanted to put here that for some reason, as much as I could see he had his 'demons' throughout, my first thought of the ending was not suicide.  Brilliant film, was absolutely sobbing by the credits."

They sort of take too much time, money, and cooperation that a guy like me will probably never get the opportunity to make a film. If I could though….  I've heard stories about how in film school there are certain circles. You got your Nolan guys, David Lynchers, “self made” Tarantino wannabes, finchers, marvel people, Kaufman enthusiasts and the Wes Anderson people. And I know most of those people go on to try and make a movie just like them. THERES NOTHING WRONG WITH THAT..   Just because you love their movies and want to put some of that flavor in your own work, is fine. Just please don't try and recreate Pulp Fiction or Memento. Come up with your own script. Perhaps something personal or maybe about some scenario you found yourself in that was impactful to you. Was it terrifying? Or Beautiful?   I personally remember the day of 9/11 like the back of my hand. I was 3 when it happened. I lived 30 minutes outside of Washington DC at the time and remember my Mom dropping me off at day care and there were a few parents standing in the drive way discussing something. You're not supposed to remember details from that young of an age, but I remember the emotions of that day. Like how scared I felt for my dad who worked close to the capital building. How unnerved and horrified everyone was seeing the planes crash into the Twin Towers.   What I'm trying to say is that I know the 9/11 movie has been done before, but I would try and portray the emotions I felt on that day the best I possibly can. I would probably make myself a little older and some kind of a side character. My mother and father would be the main characters and I would try and capture the intense emotional scenes of my father stuck in traffic trying to rush home to his family worrying about their safety. My mom making calls to all of her loved ones on the landline paranoid about where the planes could potentially strike.   In order to do this perfectly I feel like I would need a level of immersion that Nolan captures in 'Dunkirk' and other films where you really care about my mother and father in the movie and probably an element of suspense that fincher is so good at in his thrillers. And honestly screw it I love Tarantino. I'm shooting this thing in like 5-10 long scenes trying my hardest to have the most entertaining dialogue I can like he does. Probably not as effortless though. I'll try and use the Wes Anderson color palette in the next movie.   I'm curious to hear what y'all would do for your dream debut film?  Edit: maybe giving the day of 9/11 an apocalyptic feeling to it. I probably wouldn't tell the viewer right off the bat that this is what it is about. However I would subtly allude to it by building up the suspense. I'd have Florence Pugh play my Mom and perhaps Robert Downey Jr or John Krasinkski play my Dad."

Alyssa even has a monologue where she talks about how unfair it is that we refuse to explore love with both genders since it makes it easier to find the one.

Now i see Spielberg is doing a similar thing with the fablemans but somehow its a masterpiece and all the same criticisms made to Iñarritu dont apply in here.  So now I kinda see his point in this.   Theres some bias towards one filmmaker which I wouldnt accuse it of being racism as Iñarritu claims but it is strange imo.   Both films deal with the origins of their author and both films take inspiration from Italian classics. Bardo from 8 1/2 and The Fablemans from Cinema Paradiso. But again Bardo is imitative and Fablemans is a fabulous homage.   I love Spielberg work and he has always been one of my favorite filmmakers. This isnt a rant against him or The Fablemans.

But he also couldn't shut up about his kids and the songs and dances he makes up with them, and we obviously know how much he loves music and how it drives his films. And he clearly appreciates history. All of this got me thinking he should go out with his greatest challenge yet, a musical. And with no revenge theme or blood :)  Since he's written and directed some of the best portrayals of nazis in the last 30 years, just a thought that maybe it could be set during the Holocaust. How's that for a challenge?   I honestly think he has the ability to make the most glorious musical of the last 40 years instead of just tying up all his prior films of making the best Tarintino film."

        "body": "I saw a post here recently about the Wick sequel and the comments were often about how the sequels have detracted from the original's take on John's inability to overcome his adherence to toxic masculinity when dealing with the death of his wife.  It claimed he was looking for a reason to go on a rampage and that reason was the death of the puppy that his wife gave him to help cope.  I scrolled a long way and nobody mentioned the car, but the dog just kept getting mentioned.  I thought I was crazy for thinking the car was also a heavy factor in him going to war with the antagonist.  So I'm currently rewatching it, cause why the fuck not?  It's a modern action movie in a classic style with original feeling fight scenes.  Then to my apparently horrible memory's surprise, the letter that his wife sends with the dog ends with “But you still need something, someone to love, so start with this.  Because the car doesn't count.”  His own wife knew that once she was gone, the only thing in the world that John Wick would care about would be a Ford Mustang.  The movie also makes it seem clear that she knows he has no interest in having a dog, but he'll love it because she told him to, and only because she told him to.  He showed no interest in the dog until it was killed.  So why did nobody mention the car that he loved so much that his wife wanted to give him something else to take care of so he didn't obsess over it too much?  I feel like the dog was involved almost as a way to distract the audience from feeling like this man is on a murderous rampage over a car.  Am I crazy or was the car, you know, the one he kills like 20-30 people to get back in the sequel, not the real driving force for his return to his past life?  Disclaimer:  while I thought about making this post sober, I did not have the opportunity to begin this rewatch while sober,  Also, kinda a shitpost."

        "body": "In the 1994 film The Santa Clause, Scott Calvin (played by Tim Allen) is awoken to the sound of a loud noise (clatter) coming from the roof of his house. He goes outside, notices Santa on his roof and says hi to Santa. Santa is caught off guard and falls off the roof to his death. Scott puts on the suit and becomes Santa Claus. With his 6 year old son Charlie by his side, Scott delivers the gifts and then heads to the North Pole where head elf Bernard gives Scott his instructions on what to do. Scott has until Thanksgiving to get his affairs in order before he has to return to the North Pole to prepare for next Christmas.  There are so many plot holes here, it is hard to know where to begin. When Scott and Charlie arrive at the North Pole, none of elves seem sad that the previous Santa Claus died. Seeing as the elves are actually capable of using Christmas magic to save Scott when he gets arrested and Scott himself uses his magical powers to make chimneys larger so he can fit through them and conjure up a chimney when one isn't there, the previous Santa Claus should have been able to use Christmas magic to prevent himself from falling off of the roof. Scott actually asked the elves how to avoid falling off the roof. Although we do not see the elves answer his question, it is possible that they answered the question in a behind the scenes scene. Does Santa wake people up by arising such a clatter very often? In the third film, Jack Frost tricks Scott into invoking the escape Clause by getting Scott to say the magic words, while unaware that he was even holding the snow globe. Scott should have been able to go back in time and tell his younger self to stay inside. Even if Scott enjoys being Santa Claus, he could use time travel to save the life of the previous Santa Claus. Does the role of Santa really just go to anyone so puts on the Santa suit? What if someone evil had put on the suit? Regarding that last one, the third film showed us what would happen if an evil man put on the suit.  I have a possible explanation for all of these plot holes. Scott Calvin was selected to be Santa Claus. There are two different versions of this theory. In one version, the previous Santa's fall off of the roof was a planned suicide. In the other, the previous Santa Claus (the one we see on Scott's roof in the first film) was not actually a man at all, he was an animatronic Santa set to fall off the roof in front of Scott. I think that the latter makes more sense, as the former fails to explain what happened to the previous Mrs. Claus.  Peter Boyle played the role of Mr. Whittle in the first film and Father Time in the second and third film. This theory posits that the reason why these two characters where played by the same actor is because they where the same man. When the previous Santa left his job for whatever reason (maybe he died, maybe he got divorced and so he couldn't be Santa anymore), the council of legendary figures set up a plan. Father Time went on a mission to pose as an executive at a company and select one of his employees to be the next Santa Claus. He choose Scott Calvin. Bernard made it sound like being Santa Claus is a done deal, which clearly isn't the case because of the escape Clause, but Bernard wanted to make sure that Scott knew how great it is to be Santa before he found out about the Escape Clause.  Father Time probably would have known about the Mrs. Clause, so it is unlikely that he would have selected an unmarried man for the job, but maybe Scott was still married to Laura when he met Father Time and Father Time selected Scott unaware of the divorce.  What do you think do you agree with this theory? Why or why not? Let me know."

Generally I find his movies like Kids (I know he didn't direct), Gummo, and Spring Breakers to be impactful but really have very little replay value for me so it is interesting that this movie seems to have such a relaxed wandering spirit, like Moondog himself and that I seem to find such a high rewatch value in it.

Ofcourse that changed after the Baptism of fire when Micheal killed their leader along with the heads of the other 4 families.   But still while that cemented the Corleone's as the definitive superpower in the New York Mafia I find it kinda strange that not one mention of them was made in part 2.

The character of Hit Girl isn't as engaging as a high schooler compared to the whimsy we get of her as a little girl juxtaposed against mind-blowing violence.  The first half feels like a Mean Girls rip off and adds nothing. The dynamic between Dave and Mindy as well as a lot of the dialogue given to the female characters sounds like it was written by a horny teenager.

She didn't want to live so life for her only became bearable if she was living in a constant state of hyper emotion. As abusive as Nathan was to her, he was also romantic and caring and that dicothomy was something she needed at that time.   Stingo didn't understand, even after Sophie told him about her past. In a way, Nathan and Sophie stuck together because they were tortured souls. They could never be too happy. I think that's why Nathan rages at Sophie at one point because he felt she was becoming too normal and also too close to Stingo and drifting away from the love/hate bond they had.

Stingo thought he could save Sophie but she was long gone by the time he met her."

        "body": "It's unlike any other western ever made. The premise itself is just a string of gun fights. It's distinctly Raimi, with his trademark dolly shots and cartoonish gun physics. Co-producer and star Sharon Stone, whose career some might describe as uneven, is clearly giving it everything she's got. The cast includes an already legendary Gene Hackman, and soon to be mega-stars Russel Crowe and Leonardo DiCaprio, both of whom (as well as Raimi himself) Stone fought to have cast, going as far as to pay DiCaprio's salary herself. In addition there are a dozen other recognizable faces in the cast, including Keith David, Tobin Bell, Gary Sinise, Lance Henriksen, the obligatory Bruce Campbell and others.  It's not gritty realism by a long shot, but then, neither is Tombstone, and that movie certainly gets plenty of love. It's almost a Bugs Bunny cartoon, but it's grounded by Stone's earnestness. This wouldn't be the same movie with anyone else behind the camera, before Raimi became top tier with Spiderman. Stone recognized the potential of both Crowe and DiCaprio before they became household names. It's not everyone's cup of tea. Raimi's style won't be a good fit for people who prefer the traditional western aesthetic. But for those interested in the fringe of what's possible in the genre; for those interested the evolution of Raimi or it's stars, it's worth looking up this film that is 27 years old now and seems to have fallen out of discussion."

I appreciated the subtle grain and the framing of the dining scenes where it was really stiff but emphasised finery. I don't know about historical accuracy of the costumes but they were aesthetic to me as a casual movie watcher.  Kirsten Dunst was harshly criticised by french audiences for being a skinny American while I rather liked her offbeat interpretation. Her expressions were simple but added to the story. It wasn't trying to ape history, it was doing its own thing. If I wanted authenticity i'd read nonfiction and go to museums.  The music which could have quickly dated was pleasing from today's perspective. She uses music to elevate but also to offer us enjoyment and dynamism, so it's not gratuitous.

Maybe the current mainstream is a representation of a not-yet nostalgic culture, which makes it less palatable?  I mean, there is no denying that 90's movies, for example, followed a certain artistic pattern. Was that pattern better, have we managed to filter out the good apples from a mostly spoiled batch, or do we find the batch less spoiled simply because we are becoming nostalgic of that time?  If contemporary Hollywood is not objectively significantly worse, will we just view it the way we do the cinematic content of any other decade?

        "body": "im using google translator so my bad if there is any problem in english   According to Bazin, cinema comes from literature, not theater,  despite common sense:  *Without going too far into a theory of the novel -a debatable subject - let us say that the narrative form of the novel or that which derives from  it differs by and large from the theater in the primacy given to events over  action, to succession over causality, to mind over will. The conjunction  belonging to the theater is therefore, the particle belonging to the novel  is then.* *Perhaps this outrageously approximate definition is right. for the following: it characterizes the two movements of thought of the reader and the spectator*  *. Proust can prostrate us with a madeleine, but the playwright fails if each of his retorts does not keeps our interest alight for the next replica . That is why a novel may be laid  down and then picked up again. A play cannot be cut into pieces. The  total unity of a spectacle is of its essence.  To the extent that it can realize the physical requirements of a spectacle, the cinema cannot apparently  escape the spectacle's*  *psychological*  *laws, but it has also at its disposal all  the resources of the novel. For that reason, doubtless, the cinema is congenitally a hybrid. It conceals a contradiction. Besides, clearly, the progression of the cinema is toward increasing its novel-like potential. Not that we  are against filmed theater, but if the screen can in some conditions develop  and give a new dimension to the theater, it is of necessity at the expense of  certain scenic values - the first of which is the physical presence of the  actor. Contrariwise, the novel at least ideally need surrender nothing to  the cinema. One may think of the film as a supenovel of which the  written form is a feeble and provisional version.  *  (André Bazin, What is Cinema?)  To be clear, Bazin is talking about something that all of us cinephiles,  beginners  or not, *kind of* instinctively already know,   but it's different to see someone formulate it explicitly.  He is not formulating a general rule, because as we know, cinema is a mixture of several arts at once, an interweaving, there are films more focused on painting, others on sound (these first two generally being the most sensorial) , some even more theatrical, but the important thing is that literature is always there at the center of gravity ( not in the sense that the script is the most important thing, but more that the director writes with the camera).  This is just a snippet of his argument and I cannot develop it in this post alone. But the important thing is that the temporality of cinema (the narrative conjunction then) is closer to literary than theatrical (therefore).   This may seem cherry-picking, but I think it makes a pretty strong case, especially against those who see cinema as an inferior art, or that it should be taken less seriously, in the sense of being a bastard of the theater. If anything, it is closer to being a first-degree friend of literature who only indirectly borrows from the theater. This is an exaggeration, of course, as Bazin himself recognizes that there is a contradiction in cinema between these two influences -  at the same time that it is something unique and completely different from other arts .  But I remember how surprised I was when I first read this passage. It confirms many things that we cinephiles already suspect from our own experience of watching and studying films.  So if you have a problem with movies, you'll probably have a problem with literature as well (which is hardly the case for movie haters).  note: of course we must understand Bazin as limited by his time, personally I think his insistence on realism is kind of out of place, since there is no reason to limit cinema in this sense and much of the best that has ever been made always carried fantastic elements, but perhaps for realism he is talking about something else (the equality it grants to man and nature, cinema is aesthetically similar to the novel) and we could replace the term realism with naturalism, in the sense that the events have a greater proximity, as opposed to theatrical distancing (but this depends on each play and each movie too, obviously)"

We see in a flashback that Truman meets Meryl in high school but there are photos of Truman and Marlon as very young boys, and the story of their backyard camping trip as children.  &#x200B;  MY (flimsy) supporting points  &#x200B;  Photos of the two as boys (little carrot top), Marlon mentions that they have been best friends since 7 years old.  (how do you coach a child actor that young for that kind of role) I feel its more likely he had been there since day one and had been guided subtly into this role.  &#x200B;  During the search scene it feels like Marlon acts as Cristofs' proxy on the ground in seahaven, obviously all the main characters have more interaction with Cristof than the background actors but he is the only one we see have direct communication with Cristof.  &#x200B;  The much discussed you were out of  school for about a month. many people take this as a vacation/break the actor took from the show, but I think it was when he was first told about the nature of his world. the length of the break was because he may not have wanted to come back and had to be convinced/coerced to return.  &#x200B;  Marlon also seems to have spent some time away from the show hauling chickens for Kaiser this one may have been an actual vacation, but I think this was was a negotiation/contract dispute. he had grown up a bit and had possibly had another identity crisis and need to be coaxed back now that he was an adult.   &#x200B;  Marlons' job adds nothing to the community. it would make sense that in a city/set that size you would need the actors not to just pretend to do many of the jobs they are assigned, for example the people working in the grocery store probably actually run the store so the resident actors can get food and supplies for their homes. Now its also clear Meryl doesnt have a real job either so maybe thats just a perk for the central cast, but her on screen time must be greater than Marlons. He may be getting perks just for being the Truman understudy.  &#x200B;  I admit its a bit out there and there are certainly issues with it but its just my silly little theory."

I haven't seen Juno since and since I was essentially a kid when I saw it I can't judge it fairly; there were probably themes in the film I couldn't grasp and a narrative or style of dialogue that differed from other similar mainstream films.

I know some make fun of it now but I remember when it came out, soooo many really believed that it was 100% real, myself included, seeing it under that lens made it even more terrifying tbh just imagining being in that situation. I know some may see it as boring now especially when compared to other found footage films because in so many of those like REC, Cloverfield, Quarantine, Diary of the Dead, the REC films, the Paranormal Activity films etc. while I loved them, you see everything on camera, literally everything happens in front of the camera to keep your attention, whereas TBWP, it's a slowburn with alot more subtlety & it's like someone or something is messing with your head slowly as the film goes on. I know that some may also find it boring because >!you know it's not real now & you don't really see anything,!< I don't, I think the latter's exactly what makes it all the more scarier.  I mean, put yourself in their position, you're out there, >!you hear the stories from the townsfolk, you don't take it seriously, you think they're full of shit, you go out there, you and not seeing anything else for days, no other person, animal or anything (aside from the dead mouse that they saw early on before they get further in the woods), you hear the sounds of the dead children that the witch made Rustin Parr kill, you later see their bloody handprints all over the walls of his home, you can barely sleep, you don't have any food and you know that the witch is playing mindgames with you, she had them in a loop so they kept walking in circles & why Rustin Parr's house just appeared, the witch was the reason why despite having a map and a compass, they still got lost. The slow dissention between the three of them is very believable & very well acted IMHO, the confession scene near the end of the film is still one of my all-time favorite horror scenes, same for Heather's reaction to finding Josh's remains, very believable. If you were in her shoes, would you have told Mike about finding that or do you think she was right to not tell him, as he may have gotten even more emotional knowing his best friend was gone?!<  What did you think of the film? Did it scare you or unsettle you when you first saw it? How many of you actually believed that it was real? Were you still able to enjoy the film after finding out that it wasn't? And what's your interpretation of the ending? >!Do you think it was Josh, the witch, Rustin Parr or the witch controlling Josh/Parr to put Mike in the corner at the end of the movie?

        "body": "I've noticed a consensus that Toy Story 4 is not as good as the other films in the series & I used to thi k that but after recently re-watching all the films, I don't think that's the case, I think one of the reasons I didn't think it was as good was because of nostalgia tbh, for me atleast.  I watched it and thought, It was just as great as the brilliant trilogy which imo is probably the best trilogy I've seen, I think the way Toy Story works is when you thematically try to make sense out of it, ofc it's a cashgrab but that doesn't mean it's just that.  Toy Story 4 was a better ending for Woody, who in many regards is the main character of the Toy Story series.    His role throughout the films is basically a metaphor for the stages of parenthood.  Toy Story 1 - How to deal when your kid no longer needs you to be the center their world.   Toy Story 2 - The parental midlife crisis, thinking about what potential you had if you didn't have a kid, and then realizing that making your child happy is enough for you.  Toy Story 3 - Letting go, when your kid is old enough to go off and be their own adult.  Toy Story 4 - Empty nest syndrome, and how to cope when your life doesn't revolve around your kid any more.   The third film was about knowing when to let go. The fourth film is about what to do once you've let go, thus actually completing Woody's story arc.  >  Toy Story 4 becomes less of an attempt to tie in previous themes       Every one of the movies is thematically consistent, as they're all about Woody's purpose in life, be it having that feeling threatened, questioning if it's the right purpose, letting go of that purpose once he's no longer needed, or finding a new purpose for himself. Toy Story 3 is a better ending for the franchise but 4th is the better ending for Woody who has one of the best written arcs in the animation medium overall.  Woody is not the Toy Bonnie needed and thus he didn't need to stay with her, it's not out of the character for Woody, infact it's the natural progression of his character.   Him going with Bo is the best way I see his character going.  And speaking of Buzz, he always wanted to get back to the friends, I don't think either his or Buzz's character had a big change in this film, only character with a drastic change was Bo."

It's because they have bad endings, especially after all that the main characters had gone through, nothing happened to the bad characters, and the story felt incomplete. It was all for nothing and a complete waste. I feel like nothing has been achieved in those movies. And I hated what happened. Even though I didn't watch them in 2017, the year it was released, I kept thinking it was a cursed year for me. And for others, I so wish the movie was completely different and much better, cause I wanted something different especially since I can't find a good movie that stars the people I like. And the characters didn't get the punishment/karma they deserved especially with how badly they treated people and how badly they behave. They were all enough to traumatize me. And now, I honestly hate a lot of the cast and crew members of these movies and TV shows. And I prefer other characters over others that are not in movies I hate.  Even though I have only seen these movies once, they still have haunted me even today. Honestly, they do make me sick to my stomach. Like I would lose my mind. If I'm being honest, I really don't get why people like these movies so much or why they even make them. They have traumatized me for years. And really I was so crushed and heartbroken, I sometimes can't be my normal self again even if they are just in fictional movies. I get sensitive to these things. When it happens, I feel like I'm in a cage with all these movies trapping me in it. When I watch something to distract myself, I'm let out of the cage for a few minutes or hours, but then get shoved back in whenever those movies pop into my head again. I even had the power to imagine parts of a movie that acts as a sequel to one of these movies if there really was one and it felt good. But when I think too much about the bad movie, I feel weak, and I can't imagine parts of my imaginary sequel to make me feel better.  I don't want to say how I feel about the cast and crew in real life though.  Maybe it would be better to wish for those movies were erased from my memory forever and that I would have no chance of coming across them ever again!  And for the record, some of the movies I do hate which I would talk about above (without the titles) are actually Korean, but that doesn't make me like an anti-Korean person or something like that. I just have issues right now. Big issues that I hope to overcome somehow."

Others would argue that Kubrick wouldn't have approved of it, if it was his film and not Spielberg's. I wholeheartedly disagree.  Also, remember that sex scene in Munich that occurred later in the film when Avnet (Eric Bana) was seeing visions of the killings? He couldn't get pleasure from being intimate from his wife because his traumas became a major turn-off for him. The movie got flacked for that scene as well; hence Spielberg made another bad creative decision. Again, I disagree.  Now whether you like the movies or not is entirely your opinion, but I want to address is that Spielberg would get unfairly criticized over from others who prefer that he “stays in his lane”. If it had been Kubrick whom directed A.I. EXACTLY the way we saw it scene-by-scene/shot-by-shot everyone would've called it “genius”, including the divisive ending (Or as it aged like Shining or Eyes Wide Shut). If it had been someone like Oliver Stone, Martin Scorsese, Francis Ford Coppola, William Friedkin, etc that directed the divisive Munich sex scene then they would've gotten all the praise, because they are more daring with their works than “sentimental Spielberg”.  There are filmmakers who direct features well outside their comfort zones that become hits, and other times are misses. But Spielberg seems like one of those elites whom critics prefer to stay within his comfort zone. Even when he tries to be audacious he'll get bashed for such moments that other filmmakers would earn credit for it.  Thoughts?  P.S. Let's leave out the truly dumb moments that I'm sure Spielberg had a hand in making (eg Lost World gymnastics)."

That being said, they are both really...REALLY weird.  Like, take the first film for example, the film is about Scott Calvin (played by Allen), who works for a Toy Company as a salesman, having Christmas with his son, Charlie, I should also mention he is divorced, well, anyways, at first it doesn't go too well, as he literally burns the dinner and has to eat at Dennys...the American version *Duh, Duh, Duuuuuuuuuuuuuuuh* anyways, later that night around bedtime, they hear a noise on the roof which turns out to be Santa, and as Scott calls to him, Santa falls to his death, leaving his clothes, a card, and a latter, when they get up there they end up on Santa's sleigh and after a night of delivering toys, they end up in the North pole where they find Santa's village. One of the elves Benard, explains to Scott that once he puts on the suit he becomes Santa.  From there, the film becomes really, REALLY weird and insane, also, really dark. His kid starts becoming obsessed with Christmas and the idea of his dad being Santa, to the point he has to explain to him it was just a dream, well...actually he bribes him with 5 bucks...so...yeah, and he then starts turning into Santa claus, he starts eating sweets like crazy, he starts gaining weight at an extremely fast rate, he starts growing a white beard at a fast rate, he starts dressing up as Santa, and it causes his whole life to fall apart, losing his son and losing his job, and when he leaves to deliver presents again, and takes his son as well, everyone believes he kidnapped him, and he gets arrested. But he is able to convince his ex-wife and her new partner that he really is Santa at the end, so there is that.  As for the second movie, where we learn that apparently the card stated not only if he put on the suit he would become Santa, but also has to marry someone and have a Mrs. Claus to continue being Santa, which kindof contradicts the first film, since the original Santa who died didn't seem to have a wife and was still Santa but okay. And the film doesn't take too long to get crazy, because we also see other mythical figures like Mother Nature, Father Time, Tooth Fairy, the Easter Bunny, etc. Which raises so many questions, mainly do they have a Clause just like Santa too? If so, does this mean Father Time is his boss from the last movie? Anyways, in order to not let the elves know he is gone, one of his elves (played by that kid from Cat in the Hat) gives Santa the idea of making a Toy Santa to act as a stand in while he is gone, and while he is gone Toy Santa literally becomes Toy Hitler/Stalin, and installs a tyranical dictatorship in the North Pole and forces all the elves to give every kid in the world coal!!!   Also I guess Scott also goes there to try and understand why his son is being bad, and that's the other reason he lives, but that doesn't really go anywhere until like the very end, and it's just mainly about him trying to find a wife, and he falls in love with his sons principal, and he messed it up by telling her he is Santa. Anyways he finds out from the one elf that Toy Santa had gone mad and they have to go back to stop him, which they do thanks to Toothfairy and they get caught instantly, also his son convinces his principal he is Santa and they also go to the north, also thanks to Tooth fairy, anyways, they stop Toy Santa and Scott and the Principal get married and he continues being Santa, oh and the principal had the same transformation Scott did, since she now looks like an older lady during the credits. Don't even get me started Comet becoming fat, and autistic Reindeer named Chad.  So yeah, they are pretty weird, so why do I like them then? Well for one, like I said, they are weird, I like weird stuff, and secondly, it's the other things about the film as well. For example, the first one has alittle bit of a dark edge too it, the jokes feel a little bit more edgy (Benard almost losing it on Scott being the best of the jokes), and the film acknowledges the fact, that Scott's transformation kindof ruins his life, and the second film while it's alittle more lighthearted, with Santa feeling more like traditional Santa in the film, and the plot being kindof by the numbers, the film makes up for it with the chemistry between the Principal and Santa being pretty decent actually, but also the Dynamic between him and his son is well done, plus, while the jokes aren't as edgy as the first, it's still really funny and had me laughing many times. Plus, Toy Santa is the best part of this film, it's just so bizarre and silly and insane and it just works so well, mostly because Tim Allen hams it up like crazy and is clearly having a blast playing Toy Santa, and is just having so much fun playing the role, and is pretty much one of, if not the main reason the second one is my favorite.  Why did I make this post? Idk, I'm just really in the Christmas spirit right now, and I really wanted to talk about the first two Santa Clause films...not the third one, the third one blows/sucks."

During his banishment, he basically learns that not everything needs to be physically pointed to have a point(i.e. a purpose, motivating factor, etc.)  I get the impression that, for example, in Spanish punto doesn't have the same multiple meanings that point does in English.

He goes trying to find him and sees Mac's dead eyes starting at him and hears his pre recorded voice 'Anytime' the music then tense ups and we see him finally locking eye to eye with the Predator in a mexican esque stand off. The creature flashes his eyes yellow while camouflaged as to almost tease Dillons prior position of complete denial of the creatures existence, it then starts to circle him. By the time Dillon lifts the two MP5's and fires a shot, a laser blast takes one of his arms, the gun drops still firing as he screams in agony, the creature then picks up pace circling him before casually walking up to him and impaling him with its wristblades. Gives me goosebumps just writing about it.  And the second its the Sllma Hayek table dancing scene in From Dusk Till Dawn, The music, the direction the acting everything is just so incredibly seductive, especially when she lets her hair loose and headbangs to the song."

As most everyone knows, the original Planet of The Apes (1968) shows a group of astronauts crash landing on an alien world populated by highly evolved and intelligent apes and primitive mute humans. The roles are reversed from our world. The main character, Taylor, ultimately finds a half buried Statue of Liberty and learns that he is in fact on Earth and that mankind destroyed themselves with nuclear weapons.  This is some pretty apparent social commentary about the Cold War and dangers of nuclear escalation.  Two years later Beneath the Planet of the Apes is released and follows another astronaut from a different ship who follows basically the same path as Taylor, only to find a colony of intelligent and more advanced subterranean humans that have in their possession a nuclear bomb. He also finds Taylor.   There is also a plot about the highly militaristic gorillas and political elite orangutans subjugating and terminating the humans.   The Apes find them and a fight ensues, and a mortally wounded Taylor detonates the bomb. The screen goes blank followed by the sound of an explosion and the narrator speaks about the planet now being dead.    It is a very bleak and kind of confusing ending for me. I think maybe it is a commentary on the circular nature of conflict and history repeating itself. It feels like a hopeless and nihilistic message.

Other than Superman, Christopher Reeve was also fantastic in Somewhere in Time, a very underrated film, and Deathtrap. Reeve was also great in The Bostonians, The Aviator, And The Remains Of The Day and show his range in those films.  Despite that, I feel as though Christopher Reeve had unmark potential that was wasted. He was offered a lot of role, American Gigolo, Body Heat, The World According To Garp, The Bounty, Splash, Fatal Attraction, Romancing The Stone, Lethal Weapon, Pretty Woman, The Running Man, Total Recall, And Philadelphia. Reeve realized Hollywood producers wanted him to be an action star. He later said, I found most of the scripts of the genre poorly constructed, and I felt the starring roles could easily be played by anyone with a strong physique. In addition, he did not feel he was right for the other films he was offered . Though I respect Christopher Reeve's decisions and that He was a great nevertheless.

I like the use of recurring characters throughout the series, especially depending on the missions. The Secretary is the only one that seems to either die or almost die. The star of course being Ethan Hunt. The use of technology is also handled well (although its mostly science fiction at this point).

(Unfortunately Hollywood generally makes such honest plots difficult to locate.)  But whether popular film or not (new or old film; regardless of origin country or language so long as English subtitles exist) I am looking to find films that will tackle **the end of the world without the hopeful twist that inevitably occurs in the last 20 minutes of every such film** -- which addresses the last three or fewer minutes in the story, before the sun explodes, or the aliens arrive, or the earthquake happens, and so forth-- where the humans magically make it through unsurvivable circumstances due to really dense plot armor. Wile E. Coyote style plot armor. Like the audience will not notice or will need to suspend their disbelief MASSIVELY quality plot armor.  I want an *honest* look at a disaster scenario or an end of the world possibility-- (e.g. Nuclear war to aliens; virus to overpopulation; climate change wars to class wars)-- not one where the writer clearly dreamed up something impossible to cope with and then spirits his characters through and manufacturers science-esque words, just to prove how wonderful humans are (as if they actually are rad instead of the garbage that most of them are in a crisis).  I want--if it's unsurvivable-- for humans as a species to not survive. This shouldn't be so difficult to locate, but it definitely is. So if you have any suggestions*where the world of humans is ending for X reason, and zero humans survive; but animals, plants and the landscape continue on* or at least just, the humans don't, I'd be thrilled to see it.  Final note: Please do not suggest any of the following, as I have already seen them (and many don't even meet my criteria, but humans typically suggest them anyhow).  - Don't Look Up - Threads - The Mist - The Thing  - The Cabin in the Woods - Knowing - War of the Worlds - Book of Eli  - The Day After - Where Have All The People Gone?  - Children of Men - I am Legend  - Independence Day - Deep Impact - The Core  - 2012 - The Day After Tomorrow - Snowpiercer  - 28 Days Later - Interstellar - Geostorm  - Arrival - Bird Box - WWZ - The 5th Wave - The Quiet Place"

Its kinda crazy to think that considering how much money D9 made compared to its budget and how it was the breakout film for Copley and Blomkamp. I know he was preoccupied with films like Chappie and Elysium but i keep wondering why he isn't making D10.  I realised after a while that I'm not sure what D10 would even be about since D9 was an allegory for segregation and racism so I'm not sure how you make a sequel to a film that was created to tell a moral message. I have a feeling Neil is suffering from the same problem. So pretending for a moment you were Neil Blomkamp, what would you make D10 about and what would the story be?"

So really licorice pizza isn't that much different except that the scenes are disjointed and there's no real progression for one scene to the next. It's just a series of snapshots.

If i had to amass a list of my top 5 directors, it'd probably consist of (in no particular order) Stanley Kubrick, the Coen Brothers, Martin Scorsese, Quentin Tarantino, and David Fincher. Nothing wrong with these directors or their work, but I do feel like i'm missing out on a lot of great film from around the world.  In 2023, i'm planning on taking on a director each month and diving into their work. I'm shooting for 4-5 films per director to start with (don't want to burn out on this idea) but am open to compiling maybe a top 10 must-see or most important list from each director, and then chipping that down to a top-5 for each.  Not every director on my life is foreign, but some are just ones that i've been meaning to explore as well. I'm open to swapping out some of these directors, and in particular i'd like to have some more women on this list. Open to any/all advice and any/all recommendations for these director's best works.  The list i've put together as of now consists of:  Akira Kurosawa  Ingmar Bergman  Hayao Miyazaki  John Cassavetes  Jane Campion  George Roy Hill  Jean Luc-Godard  John Ford  Brian De Palma  Yorgos Lanthimos  Roman Polanski  Orson Welles"

Every chapter was a primer on a different religion and my teacher supplemented each chapter with a movie that he thought was relevant and illustrated the basic principles of the religion. So, for example, we watched Spirited Away for the Shinto chapter.  For the Buddhism chapter, my teacher brought a movie called Zen Noir, which has become a personal favorite of mine. It's a goofy story about a hard-boiled noir detective investigating the sudden death of a Buddhist monk and it's full of slapstick comedy, but it has a surprising amount of depth and a much more dramatic undercurrent that comes to the surface over time. It clearly had no budget to speak of, but they got around it by shooting the movie in the style of a black-box theater, with the set being a literal black room with minimal set dressing that could be swapped in at will. And it does a great job of explaining the zen Buddhist concept of impermanence and connection with all things.  It's a weird movie and I haven't met anyone else who's heard of it, but I love it. It's a champion of minimal budget film making and I think its goofy tone transitions into the more serious tone very effectively. Has anyone else seen it, and if so what are your thoughts?"

To the extent that there is an American counterpart to James Bond, it would be Harry Callahan, not Ethan Hunt. Ethan Hunt is a copy, not a *counterpart*.

I watched Stalker few months ago and even tough i admire it's themes and technical aspects i still can't bear the film because it is so slow and uninteresting. It's not like i hate slow movies i love movies like Godfather etc. But i cant tolerate arthouse slowness.   Then comes the eraser head which I tried to watch few weeks ago as i was excited about it because of its plot and i have to say it was a huge disappointment! Now i wanted to see David Lynch 's mullohland drive but now i am avoiding that film because I was not able to complete eraser head.   The first 10-20 mins  was such a big disappointment for me with no dialogues i expected it to start like psycho(1960) rapid and fast. It's not like i hate silence in films there will be blood had no dialogues in its first 10-15 mins but it was engaging for me.   Then today I tried the seventh seal as it was considered to be one of the greatest films of all time and again i was disappointed. I expected the movie to be completely a chess game played between the knight and the death but it went somewhere which was not expected so dud imo.   Overall my complaints regarding these films are same. They have intersting plot deep themes amazing technical aspects but i just can't complete these films.  Maybe i am not a tarkovsky,Bergmann guy rather than i am more of Scorsese, Tarantino,Nolan,Fincher, Kubrick,PTA,Coen brothers,Sergio Leone etc.   What are your thoughts regarding arthouse films and the post would love to know your opinion."

I don't think I've ever seen a movie sequel say screw it, we're gonna do whatever the hell we want the way Gremlins 2 did. Also, the brainy Gremlin is still hilarious 30+ years later.  Another one that comes to mind is Texas Chainsaw Massacre 2. While not up to the levels of craziness that Gremlins 2 hits, Tobe Hooper went in a completely different direction for the sequel to Texas Chainsaw Massacre. Whereas the first one had a very gritty and realistic feel, the sequel goes in a much more comedic/cartoony direction and just has a completely different tone than it's predecessor. Dark humor scenes like the deranged cook winning a chili contest with chili made from the family's victims and other things like the Chop Top character would have felt way out of place in the original movie.

I have no clue why they decided to split the story into three parts, since the story is simple to follow, I get that a lot of stuff happens in the plot, but still, making a trilogy based on something that wasn't a trilogy in the first place is unneeded. Sure, it was fun getting each installment around Christmas, but my point still stands.*  *Despite the rant I just had, I actually have fond memories of The Hobbit trilogy. I first started getting into The Hobbit and The Lord of the Rings when I was in middle school after me and my friend played LEGO The Lord of the Rings and that blew my mind. You could say that my friend was like a guide to the entire Middle Earth saga. Of all of the movies in this trilogy, this was the only one that I did not see in the theater. Since I've already reviewed The Lord of the Rings trilogy, it was inevitable that I would cover The Hobbit trilogy as well.*  Plot: Sixty years before *The Lord of the Rings*, Bilbo Baggins is convinced by the wizard Gandalf the Grey to join thirteen Dwarves in order to reclaim their kingdom from the dragon Smaug….  >!The titular journey doesn't start until 40 minutes into the movie.!<  Characters: The characters are mostly fine, for the most part. Bilbo Baggins, played by Martin Freeman, is probably the best character in this whole trilogy. He brings so much life to the character of Bilbo and he makes the movie feel less boring. I also like how Bilbo starts off the movie by not wanting to join the adventure, >!but by the end, he has found his new courage.!< Gandalf, once again played by Ian McKellan, is as charming as he was in *The Lord of the Rings* trilogy. As for the new characters, they're pretty good. Thorin Oakenshield, played by Richard Armitage, is leading the company of dwarves all while trying to reclaim their kingdom. I like his determination at trying to accomplish his goal, and you want to see the company accomplish said goal, even though there's times when Thorin can act like a jerk to Bilbo. As for the other dwarves, they're fine. I like how they can be nice to Bilbo. Although there's a lot of them, I can easily remember the names. You may think that's just me being a nerd, but I remember them for two reasons: One, I read the original book in middle school. And two, the LEGO game displays the name of each dwarf once you play as them. Speaking of the book, I clearly remember that the character of Azog, played by Manu Bennett in the trilogy, was only mentioned once in the first chapter. (It was also mentioned that he was a goblin). Here, they make him an orc as well as one of the main villains in the trilogy.   Tone: Like *The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring* (2001), this is also the first installment of an epic fantasy trilogy.   Music: While not as memorable as the other trilogy, the music is still enjoyable and a fun treat to listen to. I remember listening to “Misty Mountains” all the time when I was younger. Upon listening to it after many years, it still has the same feeling of preparing to start an epic journey, and I love it.   Before I wrap this up, let's talk about my favorite two scenes in this movie: Goblin Town and Riddles in the Dark, although in the movie, the two scenes happen at the same time. Anyways, there are a lot of fun scenes in this first installment, but these two scenes were always my favorites. Let's start with Goblin Town. Aside from using a green screen for the majority of the trilogy, the Goblin Town scene is a lot of fun and is filled with danger at every turn. It is also one of two scenes that I remember the most from this movie. Plus, the Great Goblin is awesome, >!despite having a small role.!< The other scene that I enjoy is the Riddles in the Dark scene for four reasons: One, it's great seeing Andy Serkis play Gollum again; Two, this scene is one of the key moments from the book; Three, the scene has a dark and mysterious atmosphere; And four, the idea of Bilbo trying to escape while being chased by Gollum is a terrifying situation to be in.   *The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey* is a slow, decent start to this prequel trilogy. I may have liked this first installment a little more than most people, but I can see how this can make a lot of people lose interest.  Rating: 6.5/10"

I'd say it'd be best to do The Magician's Nephew next, it's probably the more inviting movie, it works as anyone's first introduction to Narnia and brings back the star power of Tilda Swinton (and Liam Neeson).  Then you could do The Horse and His Boy but I would suggest re-writing it so that the four Kings and Queens are more involved in the story - and the best part, now that the original actors are older they can all play their parts.  Then there's a recast just for Eustace in the Silver Chair, but we can keep Caspian's original actor.  And then an epic conclusion with the Final Battle.  I feel like on paper this could be a slam dunk fantasy series to continue with.  It feel it will be a shame to see just another generic streaming fantasy series on Netflix. I have little faith that they can deliver anything better than the films did."

I would like to bring up the death of fake Henry and Eli, and Daniel's ruthless diatribe on HW right before the ending. It seems to me that the death of Henry is somewhat pointless, as the best way Daniel could do was simply asking him to leave once and for all. But the death of Henry is justified, as it shows how Daniel is transitioning from a person with brotherly love to a ruthless money-driven and even satanic businessman, and harbingered for Daniel's termination of relationship with HW later.  The death of Eli in the ending scene is more unjustified than death of fake Henry imo, but I have thought of two ways to explain the scene. The first perfunctory one is Daniel wants to punish Eli for the previous public humiliation in the church and retaliate for Eli's failure in investments. The second explanation is showing Daniel's apathy toward religion has turned into utter sacrilege, and himself is transformed into a demonic character eventually.  It was very disturbing to watch the deaths of fake Henry and Eli, and Daniel's ending the bond with his stepson HW. But I do want to appreciate this film as one of the few movies where the protagonist is actually the villain."

Who are those actors who you think have the ability to shift and transform from role to role and in what movies have they done this best?

It started the undying trend of “slowed down cover of hit song” while showing various images from Facebook. Great stuff.   Worst - Black Adam. Probably not one of the worst trailers ever, but I had to sit through it so many times and there's absolutely nothing interesting or exciting about it. Makes it look like the entire movie was filmed in a single room with a green screen.  Worst - Black Christmas 2019.

        "body": "Both movies have a similar setting, both were directed by Frank Darabont and both were based on stories written by Stephen King. Yet I think they're different enough from each other as to not to call Green Mile a ripoff.  After watching Shawshank for the first time a few years ago and being blown away by how good it is, I finally watched The Green Mile with my wife a few nights ago. I was expecting a merely good movie riding on the coattails of Shawshank's reputation but came away surprised at how good it is.   For a 3h movie, I never felt bored nor did I feel that my attention was slipping. The characters were interesting and well portrayed, the dramatic moments hit well and the supernatural elements were unexpected yet fit well within the story. The only flaw I see in the movie is that some moments were *a bit* convenient for the plot (the Warden letting a prisoner touch his wife and Percy's fate). Regardless, It's a 5/5 movie for sure.  I do think I lean towards Shawshank but not by much. The thing is that while both movies have their light and dark moments, you could make the argument that Shawshank tends to go darker more often so the more tender moments stick with you.  Now, the one flaw (not really a flaw but more of a personal taste kind of thing) that I have with Shawshank are the rape scenes. While they aren't as graphic as say, Pulp Fiction, they're rather tough to watch. Rape is also a part of The Green Mile's plot but it's much more in the background and in a smaller capacity so it doesn't disturb me as much.  I also think that I might be biased towards Shawshank cause I found the movie during a very rough part of my life and the ending made me feel a lot better.  Of course Shawshank is the more famous movie but which one do you prefer?"

I just got done watching the second one for the first time and even though it's still not high art, I do think it's better. It's directed better (which is strange since I usually like Stallone as a director and he did the first one but not this one), the villain's more intimidating, and I think the story and setting have a little more meat on their bones this time.  But what I really have to appreciate it for is taking the last 30 minutes to give fans of old school action the most epic crossover event that can realistically happen. It's super cheesy with all the catchphrases, but I didn't care. It's shot really well, it's super fun and satisfying to watch, and >!that shot of Stallone, Schwarzenegger, and Willis all firing heavy artillery in the same frame!< is about to become my new desktop.  Like I said, the first one isn't anything to write home about, and I'm nervous about the third one with it's on the wrong time and PG-13 rating, but this franchise was more than worth it just for this one part of this one movie."

If something is both among the best series/films ever made *and* tells the best mystery, that's amazing, but I'm looking specifically for the latter.  Take Dark and True Detective S1, for instance. Most would probably say True Detective S1 is the better series, and I wouldn't argue too hard. And the story is fantastically woven for sure. But the actual mystery itself pales in comparison to those of Dark (still a great one, but Dark is just insane). What makes True Detective S1 stand out so much in comparison to other shows, apart from its story, is the writing and the characters, which are incredible. So many great scenes and fantastic quotables, particularly from Rust (as much as he can be so fucked up and insanely nihilistic).   The reason I mentioned two series in a subreddit about films (I kinda consider television and film as the same medium tbh just with one typically being longer form) is that I really haven't seek that many mystery films where the mystery itself was that remarkable or crazy  Seven, for example, is definitely one of the greatest movies I've ever seen, but the mystery itself wasn't such a huge factor, I mean the antagonist practically turned himself in, it was his characterization that made him so compelling. It's not really that fair of a comparison either, since due to having longer overall runtimes, series have a huge advantage in telling twisted, complex, deep mysteries. But I want to leave room for both movies and television to be a part of the discussion, and this is the deeper, richer, more historic medium by far to pull from."

I really don't remember the details of the premise I just remember the character/s had maybe a decision to make after they died. Like you got to choose one memory to take with you or one special circumstance in your life and that became heaven.

Today, I (south asian) was talking to my friend (white) that I watched 12 years a slave and was really uncomfy by this movie since it was sad seeing all the stuff that happened. I then bring up how Paul Dano says the nword and it's funny seeing the riddler say that. We then get into this really interesting topic on the nword in films.   She says that she doesn't think white people should say it in movies and that if they do they should add a bleep. I tell her that in movie like these, they're trying to make it historically accurate so it makes sense to have it in there. Plus, if you add bleeps to a movie that's supposed to be serious, I feel like it takes away the seriousness of it since bleeps are kind of silly. She said she agrees that if she heard a bleep she would think it's silly but it's better than hearing he nword said by whites. I said I get what she means, but, the point of movies like these is so we look back on history and realize how sad and disturbing it was so nothing like it happens again. And if we don't make it accurate, it doesn't convey the message properly.    This still peaked my curiosity and I asked two of my black friends what they think about this topic. They both said that if the majority of the people writing and acting in these films are black people, then it makes sense esp in the context of a movie like this.   I wanted to come on here and also ask fellow film watchers in the black community especially to see how they personally feel ab this touchy topic!!  Edit: I made it into paragraphs, sorry for not doing it originally :))  Other edit: I don't mean to offend anyone. I just want to know how to think of it since I'm not black and don't know how to feel ab the word in movies; looking for enlightenment😎"

Do you think that her real life is a projected simulation as well?  I'm sure other people are wondering the same thing, but when all the lights started exploding at the end, and we see the simulation fade out a little bit later, does that mean that she broke the whole simulation - what do you think the point of those details were? And lastly, Why do you think Chris pines wife killed him?   In her gut, i think Alice knew that she was suffocating. When the walls would close on her, or things wouldn't make sense, it's almost like a subconscious part of her was trying to get back.  I loved how showing a patriarchal idealistic world is a narrative on status quo vs. feminism. but I think the fact that the men practically enslave their wives to be a part of the simulation in the first place, is another layer enforcing the same theme. I think that a lot of people would rather live in a perfect smoke-and-mirrors world instead of deal with real life problems, so it's interesting to see how hard she thought to get back to reality."

She invested this word, which she used as a synonym for 'possessions' but seemed to derive from the 'sundries shops' in the many hotels to which she had already been taken, with considerable importance, dizzying alternations of infancy and sophistication. One day after she had asked me for a Magic Marker I found her marking off an empty box into 'drawers,' or areas meant for specific of these 'sundries.' The 'drawers' she designated were these: 'cash,' 'passport,' 'My IRA,' 'Jewelry,' and, finally -- I find myself hardly able to tell you this-- 'Little Toys.'  Correct me if I'm off my rocker, but are those not >!\\*mostly if not all\\* the same labels as the boxes in Lynda Tarr's childhood closet?!<  I know Field worked with Didion, so it feels impossible this could be a coincidence? I would imagine an homage to her, as BLUE NIGHTS would've come out long after Tarr's childhood was over..?  Also does anyone else think 'Petra' is named for *The Bitter Tears of Petra von Kant* ?

I agree that too much horrible character time does indeed sink such movies. An overplotted, overcharacterised movie with boring characters that are given too much detail but are poorly dramatised indeed ruins the fun.  Making the characters simple and functional vehicles for the silly action is tried and tested from *Them* to the original *Kong*, but it works best when they have charisma to make it pop with primarily broad strokes, and simple, clear motivations that propel the movie. In other words, quality rather than quantity.   *Them, Top Gun Maverick, Fury Road, John Wick, 300*, the bits of *Skull Island* that work.  Good, streamlined character work appropriate for the style of the movie makes the action vastly more exciting. Bland ciphers make it more boring (the other bits of *Skull Island*). Nothing sells an action scene and makes it exciting like a character you're invested in!  So, *Skull Island* - way too many useless characters, especially our two leads being so boring. But if the movie whittled it down to focus on Jackson, Goodman and C. Reilly the movie would have been so much more fun as a spectacle because the spectacle itself is good (maybe even exceptional), those characters fucking slapped, and we wouldn't be left with all the boring useless downtime.  And I think the only thing standing between *Pacific Rim* and it being a great movie is that Raleigh Becket is exactly the type of broad cipher who's written just enough to compel the action properly, but he's cast with Charlie Hunnam, who can be a good character actor sometimes but has no charismatic star power. An actor who can play such a broad, simple role with aplomb would have pulled that whole movie together. Instead we're left with a vacuum in the middle.  Imagine how *300* would barely hang together if Leonidas was just okay.  What killed *Godzilla 2014* wasn't so much not enough action - the movie was working - not because Bryan Cranston's character was so especially deep or nuanced, but because he's good and you were \\*invested\\*. Seeing him encounter the action scenes with what he was trying to do was amazing and would have continued to be so. That stuff just makes the spectacle so much more exciting.  When they replaced him driving the father-son dynamic, with his son on his own being a bland generic character with no purpose other than moving from one set piece to another, the momentum of the film died, despite the set pieces being amazingly constructed (when it comes to a sense of scale, Gareth Edwards is peerless). If that dynamic had been sustained, the grumbles about lack of action (there's more monster screentime than in *Jurassic Park*) and cutaways would have been far more muted.  *Kong vs Godzilla* was just bonkers and committed enough to work with shit bland characters, but that's a lightning in a bottle achievement in itself. Most films that try that stay boring and never take off."

It's a risky and ambitious story that plays the themes of violence, rejection, and reformation.  Stanley Kubrick is honestly a director that I need to revisit. I've seen most of his work before, including this film, but I always remembered how thematic and visually pleasing this film was when I first saw it. Now, after a rewatch, I really love how much effort Kubrick took in telling a timeless dystopian tale of a devilish man being exploited, punished, and surprisingly forgiven to an extent.  Malcolm McDowell as the lead character, Alex, is charming, mischievous, manipulative, and at a certain point, a bit empathetic. Honestly, he is what makes this film so engaging is because even though the character of Alex commits so much unspeakable and indefensible crimes, McDowell plays him with such humanity and a lack of tolerance so well that you can't help but get sucked into his perspective. Specifically, the scene where Alex returns home to his parents, such a conflicting scene to behold. The supporting cast is also really good, and their respective characters are super outlandish and memorable.  The writing is really eloquent and includes a lot of conversations that seem to have inside information, but as the film continues, those details start to come back in a great way. The use of narration also is incredible, which tons of films fail to do. This has some of the best production design I've seen in cinema with very colorful and psychedelic color palettes and patterns that are really cool looking. The pacing actually was perfect, the cinematography is amazing as it uses very symmetric framing and claustrophobic close-up shots, the costume design is stellar, and the score which has a variation of Beethoven is really top-notch. My only issue is that the ending, while understandable, is not exactly satisfying or feels conclusive to me.  Overall, while a very sexual and unsettling film, it executes its plot in a really unique and compelling way. Also, that police mustache guy is awesome.  What did you guys think about this film?"

Can honestly say I enjoyed this more than any Fast and Furious movie since Fast Five.  Enjoyed the first. This one is better. There's a decent recap at the beginning so you can jump right in if you want to skip the original.  I swear whenever Netflix drops one of their actually good originals, there's almost zero publicity about it."

        "body": "For me it was Pulp Fiction. I watched it in 2012 and at that point I'd already decided that I was going to be watching movies by a specific criterion; only the greatest ones of all time.  So I used 3 tools to accomplish this  1. Roger Ebert's Great Movies books - 1, 2 and 3  2. AFI's 100 lists - 1997 & 2007  3. The IMDb top 250  By the time I saw Pulp Fiction, I'd already watched Psycho, Citizen Kane, Vertigo, Rashomon, The Seventh Seal, The Human Condition, The Apu trilogy and so on. At that point the greatest film I'd seen was 12 Angry Men, and it's most electrifying moment the scene in which Henry Fonda demonstrates how long it would take to hobble across a certain distance because I love practical testing of hypotheses myself.  Then I started playing Pulp Fiction--I knew who Quentin Tarantino was: the annoying little dwork in From Dusk till Dawn, who'd inexplicably written it. I was also in my 2nd semester of medical school and everybody was still testing their IQ and comparing it to famous people's--so I'd read multiple accounts that he had a 162/160 IQ. That was about it.  And the opening scene with Pumpkin and Honeybunny starts, I can't believe the dialog I'm hearing. The callous detachment of it. These characters were funny in a way I hadn't heard before: funny not to the audience, but to each other. There was a sincerity of friendship to their interaction. And above that, they were funny to their own selves. They seemed to express each thought they had in totality, in original and non-telegraphic sentences. It was a sort of crude poetry.  The film never dips and only elevates in quality with each scene, taking familiar film situations and making its characters redefine what they could be.   Travolta's delivery of Oh man, I shot Marvin in the face... still remains the greatest line reading by any actor. You'd think Marvin was a pinata he prematurely broke and ruined a kid's birthday party.  Then he gets the Wolf to say please. Can't wash his hands of Marvin's blood--makes the towel look like a goddamn Maxipad! Then he's gonna kill that nimrod on general principal as Jules defuses a tense situation. It's a crime that he makes it out of the movie alive. Poetic justice would've been him getting shot while taking a dump as he so often does at the most mistimed moments.    It was the first time I ever actually finished a movie and thought the script needed to be read. The first screenplay I ever bought, then re-watched the film with it side by side. A few thousand movies later, it remains unequalled.   Watching it now isn't as rewarding as it used to be, as there's too much to deconstruct. The use of cuts to define shifts in tone, the jarring juxtapositions of shot sizes, the application of focus as a revelation of shifts in character mood, every beat in the screenplay is communicated with maximum visual efficiency. And that makes it tough to watch as you don't wanna miss a thing.  After all this Miyazaki, Bergman, Mizoguchi, Fellini, Hitchcock, Kubrick, Kurosawa and all these other masters, it's clear they are more original visual storytellers than Quentin. But Pulp Fiction to me remains the greatest screenplay, and film ever made.  PS: I'm aware Quentin steals all his shots. In reality, so does everybody. The difference is while Kubrick was ripping off silent movies most people will never see, QT refers to vaguely popular cinema because he's not ashamed of this.  IMDb is unreliable because redditors aren't a mass of morons flocking to a website to leave an opinion. Yes, I'm aware of this too.  The AFI is just some losers that made movies.   Roger Ebert was just a hack that did nothing but watch movies then die.  These criteria aren't meant to indicate any sense of objectivity, I was simply cross-matching a few external benchmarks to determine where they had overlap, and watching those films that--  1. A critic   2. Industry insiders   3. Hundreds of thousands of regular people  --all loved.   But reddit would've been better, which is why after these realizations, I'm asking you."

I found an image of a script on wordpress which sounds VERY MUCH like what we saw, but that was the ONLY confirmation of what seems like a delusion at this point.  But since I have corroboration of this story, I know I'm not hallucinating this either now.

There's something missing so it's not quite a 5 star one but it's definitely a 4 or 4.5 one.  Anyway. It's probably not to the taste of North American audience but I like it. It's not about the war, the reason behind it or which side is right or wrong. The film is about a story of an ordinary person with her hope, wishes and traumas.  I like the fact that it depicts wars from a different perspective. It's not about valour, courage, heroes and all those nonsense. Wars are just brutal. The leaders of both sides sacrifice their own people for whatever reasons. The thing is, each sacrificed person has his/her own story, family, wishes and dreams. At the end of the day, it's the ordinary people who have to fight, die and suffer. They're also the expendables.  At some point, both sides have committed so many atrocities that they'll use anything at their disposal to gain or to win.  The film isn't a Call of Duty action movie style nor a real war drama. There's certainly something missing but it's still a decent one and I quite like it."

        "body": "This post includes spoilers for both The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey and Star Wars Episode VIII: The Last Jedi.   Musical motifs can take a great movie and make it a legendary movie. They can even, at times, take a mediocre movie and make it pretty decent. But regardless of the movies they are used in, motifs have always defined a specific character, location, or thematic element in a film.   Because of the significance they lend to these aspects of a film, they are not transferable or exchangeable. A motif that represents Superman cannot be used when some politician is doing something Superman would approve of. A motif that represents Darth Vader cannot be used when a character does something similar to what Darth Vader would do.   Despite this firm rule, franchises that run multiple decades run the risk of “flanderizing” these motifs - associating them with a general mood or with the intention of eliciting a specific reaction from the audience - instead of the specific character, place, or concept that they were created for.   Two of the most recent franchises to succumb to this are Star Wars and Lord of the Rings. In Star Wars Episode VIII, the Emperor's Theme is used when Snoke is torturing Rey for information. This is a perfect example of motif flanderization. Snoke, who is a completely different character from The Emperor, is doing something similar to what The Emperor has done in past films. He's the “big bad”, so the film uses an explicit reference to the Emperor's theme to illustrate this. Snoke is not the Emperor. Regardless of the retcons introduced by the films sequel, this character has no connection to the Emperor aside from occupying a similar role in the story.   Star Wars had 7 films prior to this one, and the Emperor's motif was attached to that specific character in the vast majority of uses. (There is a statement of the theme when Anakin is displaying dark side tendencies on Tatooine in the second prequel film, but at least it can be ascribed to Palpatine's influence over him).   In the first Hobbit film, the flanderization of motifs is even more brazen. When Thorin faces Azog, a theme heavily associated with the Nazgûl is used. For no reason. The Nazgûl make no appearance in this film, nor any in the Hobbit trilogy.   The blame for this flanderization does not, in my opinion, lie with the composers themselves. Rather, it lies with the directors. The composers created these motifs themselves, and they were created in direct association with specific characters, places, or concepts.   The directors of these films most likely listened to the music of past films, broadly associated these motifs with certain “moods”, and asked the composers to reprise those motifs to convey the mood they wanted. This can be almost entirely attributed to laziness on the part of the director, and also on the increasing prevalence of temp music during production. With franchise films that have an established music base, temp music can be even more disastrous when it comes to the musical continuity and integrity of a film. Instead of relying on films of a similar genre and tone, directors have an entire franchise of films, often composed by the same person, to rely on for inspiration for new films. Peter Jackson wants the scene where Thorin faces Azog to have the same tension and musical style as when the Nazgûl first appear in Fellowship. What we get is a copy-paste of the music from Fellowship, despite the fact that the Nazgûl motif is a motif for the Nazgûl and can't be mad-libbed to whatever scene you want.   I am neither composer nor director, so I don't know how this issue can be solved. I just know that I, as a viewer, have noticed this problem, and it irks me to no end."

Are they allowed to read books? Especially that one which would speak to their exact situation and perhaps lead to “indiscretion”   -\tOn that note, are they allowed access to any form of pop culture? Even a simulated version? Why don't any of them question the fact that they never watch the news or even a movie - and wouldn't watching a movie lead to knowledge of actors, leading to some level of interest in the outside world? Do they know who the president is?   -\tThe shopping. When she's on the trolley, the driver asks her about her going shopping. Do they go to stores? Are the people who work in the stores real?   -\tThe hallucinations. What was the wall smooshing thing? Just her brain subconsciously trying to tell her that she was trapped? Or the people in charge orchestrating it? If so why    -\tAre all these women presumed to be dead or missing in the real world? Has no one thought to check Alice's husband's apartment to see if she's there?    -\tWhy would they design it so the men die if they die in Victory? To make sure they don't leave and tell people about it? But even Chris Pines character died, and he was the leader    -\tSimilarly, why would the developers of this simulation be so exacting when it comes to certain parts and so fucking sloppy when it comes to others? Like the fact that they only came up with 3 backstories that they just repeated for everyone    Okay there are a lot more but didn't want to make this any longer.

If you're not familiar, *Edge of Tomorrow* is a sci-fi movie featuring a *Groundhog Day*-esque time-loop plot device.  I streamed the film on VUDU, just like I have for many, many movies. But this time, at the end of the movie something unusual happened: as soon as the closing title sequence finished the film immediately restarted playing from the beginning. With almost any other movie, I would have thought it was just a glitch, especially since it's never happened in any of the other many movies I've rented on VUDU. But when a movie featuring a time-loop as a central plot device automatically loops back around to the beginning without my input, I can't help but wonder if it was intentional. An Easter egg stipulated by the film's creative team? Something slipped in by a bored engineer? Is that even possible?  I tried fast-forwarding to the same part again, but it only happened the one time. I googled around and couldn't find any mentions of it.

I myself have a more broad taste and for one reason or another I got to thinking about The Divine comedy and more specifically The inferno.        I realized, and it might be somewhat of a stretch, that lightning McQueen story is very much a journey through hell all the way to the deepest circle. He starts off an egomaniac with a lack respect for anything or anyone around him because he's a hot shot he does have more talent than anyone around him but he lets it get to his head. As described in The inferno the deepest circle of hell is for traitors and treacherous behavior which is very similar to how lightning was really driven to sell out the Rustease team to join dinoco.     No one is really worth anything to him unless they can do something for him and once he's gotten all he could he's off to the next one. Upon more recent viewings I realized that all he really needed was to find somebody he respected such as doc to teach him there is more to life. But I now realize that he was really in hell because no one gave a damn about how fast he was or any of his talent or his looks.     Everything that he loved about himself was gone which was the reflection of himself to others. It was the fact that doc showed him that everything that his pride was bringing him was never going to last and one day he would be treated the same way that he treated the world. And this lesson didn't come easy he had to be dirtied and brought down a notch hooked up to a paving machine made dirty and basically a hopeless situation.     He did manage to find his way to heaven through hell and repented as shown by him turning his back on his worldly desire of the trophy to show respect to an image of his father figure, and flipping 180° on leaving Rustease to join dinoco.  Sorry if this was difficult to read I don't really know where to paragraph when I'm in a manic analytical state and I just decided to release it as it came to me.

Just and ordinary soldier experiencing the horrors of war first hand, sitting in a foxhole with his comrades as an enemy assault comes, shrapnel from the artillery bombardment flying overhead as an enemy tank approaches. A movie that makes it abundantly clear that your only choices are keeping your head down or dying. Something that makes war so gritty, so ugly, and so brutal, that noone could finish watching the movie thinking about who was right or wrong, wether the war was justified, etc. because the movie doesn't bother with such questions, as its only goal is to make us understand that noone wants to experience in real life what the main character experienced in the movie."

The comedy, both physical and through dialog, is superb, keeps the heart light even in the darkest of dark situations, then leaves you in a glass case of emotion that quickly fills up with tears as the final scenes resolve. The movie feels like it's from a different era entirely in its presentation in a very good way.   *Big Fish*. I absolutely have no desire to touch anything Tim Burton going forward, but the story and acting in that movie is superb. Every single time the ending brings me to tears thinking about how much life comes down to the relationships we have so much more so than the money or fame we achieve. The flood scene was just good foreshadowing of how the theater would look during the telling of how the story will close.   *It's A Wonderful Life*. This one's great because most of the movie is a ride back through a person's life, putting the viewer in the mindset that the totality of who we are is made up of so many moments that we often don't think about and might feel inside don't even matter. We're then treated to the final run through town, the reunions, and the resolutions that at least for me always bring the waterworks.  *The Curious Case of Benjamin Button*. There are two parts that always hit me in this one. The first is the captain's monologue at the end of the sea battle. The second is the daughter's talk and resolution with her mom. They both resonate with me for different reasons; one because of the simple truth of the captain's words following such destruction, the other because it's a much-needed release of emotion after an entire film building to it and sewn with joy & sorrow throughout, especially punctuated by the daughter reading her father's letters to her before the very final scenes. I imagine it has to be a lot to find out about your other biological parent in that way, especially finding out you were on their mind so often even though you hardly knew anything of them.   I think I'm a little different in that I didn't find the very end of the movie sad because Benjamin had lived such a long life; I found it much sadder that Daisy and Benjamin, despite having such extraordinary lives, both never got to have a full relationship with each other or their daughter. Still, the relationships that touched all their lives were pretty magnificent in their ways.   Writing this I do find it interesting that I can't think of a single pure comedy that's left me feeling as much joy as films that also include sorrow or loss. Maybe the highs are just that much higher when we've just touched the lows.  What movies give you the feels pretty much each and every time?"

I learned that my imagination was very much less intense then what Terry Gilliam could put on screen. I lit up like a dork whenever Depp quoted the text.  This book, and the film it was adapted into, are just incredible. Somehow both hilarious and terrifying at the same time.

Unlike Drumlin, who knew how to play the game, Ellie was her authentic self.

Clearly, not a team player for the government.  While the government clearly knew Ellie was telling the truth and National Security Advisor Michael Kitz tried to discredit Ellie for the sake of a coverup so the public would accept the delusions story, how would the executive special inquiry and post-mission have been with Drumlin reporting back?      KITZ: Tell me something doctor, why do you think these aliens would go to all this trouble, bring you tens of thousands of light years, and then just send you home without a single shred of proof?      ELLIE: They said that's how it's been done for billions of years.      KITZ: That's very deep, doctor. You have no proof because they didn't want you to have any.

        "body": " I just watched Trick or Treat (1986) for the first time in 25 years and it was still so much fun. I don't think I've ever seen any discussions about it here so here we go!  Its classified as horror but I never find it to be scary or gory compared to other horror movies from the same era such as Nightmare on Elm Street, Halloween, Friday the 13th or even Child's Play.  I first saw it around 1990 when I was a metalhead in high school so I really identified with the main character and his desire for revenge against the people who persecuted him. I used to listen to pretty much the same bands he did and looked a bit like him, only fatter. I was dreaming of having a room as cool as his with a large record collection and a kick ass stereo system.  I liked how they used the backward record playing throughout the movie as at the time it really freaked some people out who believed satanic messages were hidden in metal albums and could supposedly be used as incantations  (which I always found to be dumb). Reading about it now I find it fascinating that there even was proposed anti-backmasking legislation by state and federal governments during the 1980s.  The movie has cameos by Ozzy Osbourne and Gene Simmons who are really fitting. Seeing Ozzy as an televangelist decrying the evils of heavy metal music still is funny to this day because he played this character just like the real ones. And Gene as a radio DJ is very reserved and laid back which I also liked.  It would be a crime to talk about this movie without mentionning its soundtrack. I've always been into heavier bands, especially the big five at the time (Anthrax, Megadeth, Slayer, Exodus and of course Metallica) so I found the music by Fastway to be a bit on the softer side of metal but it does fit the movie theme very well and I do appreciate it.  One funny personal tidbit about it is I first saw it in french because its my native language (french canadian to be more precise), and Sammi Curr's name sounds like the expression ça m'écoeure which translates to it disgusts me or it sickens me which I found very fitting and added to the character. At the time I wondered if it was intentional or not.  Anyway if you haven't seen it already I think its worth a watch, and if you did saw it as a metal or a non-metal kid I also think its holding up very well for a movie that is 36 years old (wow, that doesn't make me any younger!). Aside from the nostalgia factor this movie is great and has no downtime or scenes that doesn't make the plot or characters progress. I wish there were move movies set in the heavy metal universe such as this one.  Thank you for reading!"

They're exactly the kind of movies I love to watch: complex inner lives of women going through an important transformation / crisis. However I can't shake this sense that there's a discrepancy between where her character's supposed to be at any given point story wise and how she conveys it.  It doesn't help knowing she makes no bones about the fact that her approach to her roles is (even the more complex ones) really simple and involves little to no prep.   I know she's one of the most venerated actresses there ever was, and beloved by audiences too. I'm not trying to offend anyone's sensibilities or disparage her choices. Just interested in having an open dialogue, and hearing different perspectives that potentially enable me to see facets of her performance I might have missed, work I should see or any other factors that might be influencing my singular experience."

But the argument could also be made that Lydia is losing her grip on reality: hearing voices, sounds, and, I would argue, putting the metronome in the cupboard.  And while it's heavily implied that Eliott is using her score, this is never confirmed, and again could simply be Lydia's fragile ego turning to paranoia.  So I ask, what happened to the performance score?"

I can definitely appreciate the technical aspects of it, but as someone who's not a Christian, some things kinda confuse me, particularly pertaining to Rodrigues' dilemma (the first couple are kinda the same question, but from different angles):  1) Why is trampling such a terrible thing to do, when it will save people's lives? Even as a priest, surely people's lives are worth more thsn your outward show of faith, right? Like, is believing but not necessarily voicing your belief out loud (due to the persecution if you do voice it) not enough? Was it so wrong of Kichijiro to preserve his life by trampling, despite still believing?  2) By not trampling, in order to avoid sinning and thus being sent to hell, you're still effectively getting people killed, so wouldn't that sentence you to hell anyway? Is safeguarding your journey to heaven with other people's lives not inherently selfish and thus damnable?  3) Was that actually supposed to be Jesus/God's voice that Rodrigues hears when he finally tramples, or was it a hallucination of some kind?"

        "body": "On Monday I had the rare opportunity to see a movie early for the first time in my life, and that was when I went to the Regal Mystery Movie event, and the movie turned out to be Spirited. Spirited stars Will Ferrell as the Ghost of Christmas Present in a world where a different person is Christmas Carol'd every year, and follows him trying to change an unredeemable businessman played by Ryan Reynolds. Now this may all sound like just another run of the mill Christmas comedy, but you'd be surprised at how high this movie's comedic peaks are, how deep this movie's emotional valleys go, and how incredibly well Will Ferrell and Ryan Reynolds can carry a tune.  To start this off, I just can't go any further without addressing how damn great this movie's soundtrack is. Every single song is nothing short of a banger that left me with a huge grin on my face and straight up dancing in my seat. The songs range from incredibly funny and self aware, to endearingly soft and heartfelt, but no matter who was singing what, every single moment of each song not only felt earned, but filled me with absolute theater kid bliss. Will Ferrell delivers the Tony win deserving performance of a lifetime, with gripping emotion sinking into each note and an unabashedly commitment to the fun, often silly lyrics. The musicality of the songs here are nothing short of phenomenal, with each track lasting just long enough so that it doesn't outstay it's welcome or feel lacking, and infectiously catchy choruses brought together by creative verses and even more ingenious bridges. These songs aren't afraid to embrace the silliness whenever they see fit, but also are more than willing to slow down for a serious verse with lyrics deeper than they have any right to be. But back to the singing, Will Ferrell isn't the only one with chops here. Ryan Reynolds belts every song with a sense of almost infectious charisma that you can't help but enjoy. All the notes are hit wonderfully, and the tone of each tune is masterfully handled.   The singing and song writing isn't the only piece that stands out here, far from it. The choreography of every single number is handled with such intricacy and care that it makes my theater nerd self feel jealous that I can't be performing up there with them. The ensemble of each group number embraces the ridiculousness of musical theater and brings an incredible charm to what would've otherwise just been another Christmas musical. The charm on display here is guaranteed to put a smile on your face with the actors committing fully to the silly movements and over the top numbers. But what good is a fantastic ensemble without a couple of extremely talented leads? Ryan and Will take the cake here in embracing the ridiculousness of what a Christmas musical should be, with the unfaltering sense of jolliness from Will Ferrell, and the incredible charm oozing out of Ryan Reynolds. The tap dancing scene during the number Good Afternoon might just be one of the best musically choreographed scenes in recent memory.  But here's where this movie succeeds where many other musicals have failed, and that's through having a captivating story led by extremely talented actors and a tightly written script that is incredibly difficult to pick apart. Every single scene in this film feels like it was written and revised to perfection, with every joke landing faster than a bowling ball dropped from a plane, and every emotional beat hitting harder than that bowling ball hits the ground. The storytelling at play here, without getting into any spoilers, made me more than invested in every single second of the film, forcing me to cry laughing in one scene, and then to just cry in the next. And all this is done while the movie is still focusing on being a musical, which never gets in the way of the storytelling. When the third song within a ten minute window started towards the start of the movie, a character began complaining about all the singing and asked if it was really necessary, to which Will Ferrell responded by stopping a few measures later. Every single scene here serves a purpose and never feels rushed, which is one of the many reasons this film is easily on the upper half of my top films of the year list.  So I saw this movie early on Monday, and have been actively checking online to find other reviews of it, trying to see other people express their love for this modern musical masterpiece, so imagine my shock when I saw the movie garnering mixed reviews online, with a shockingly low 56 on Metacritic, and an undeservedly harsh take on the movie from several top critics. The Guardian called the movie unconfident in its direction, and Slant cited it as nothing more than a parade of pop culture references and name drops. I couldn't disagree more with either of these statements, considering the film's bold direction and clear vision of what it wants to accomplish, and the deep storytelling that is only enhanced by its ironic humor and numerous references.  In closing, Spirited is a wonderful film, an even better musical, and most of all, a Christmas movie I cannot wait to rewatch every year. With it's beautiful storytelling, impressive choreography, nothing short of phenomenal music, this is a film I cannot recommend highly enough, despite what the critics may say, at the end of the day, they're just critics, it's what they do. I give Spirited a 10/10 and consider it a must watch for fans of musicals, Christmas movies, and Will Ferrell/Ryan Reynolds."

The portrayal of poverty in an indifferent city.  I'd been watching No Country for Old Men and liked Javier's acting. I'd say Biutiful was the more powerhouse performance personally, it broke my heart in a compelling way.  Themes of me vs. you, kill or be killed, dog eat dog world resonated with me. I've come to accept everyone in life generally checks for themselves first. It's still a hard pill to swallow. Life and existence is a food chain. It's not really good or bad it just is.  Also social responsibility. When you're surviving scraping by, do you lend any hand?  Critics may have not rated it highly because, it's bleak but I feel it hit right. There was meaning behind the misery. The protagonist pushes on, however messily. People are selfish and betray others, but that is a real part of human nature.  It's made me rethink life in terms of balancing my agenda with other peoples.   I recommend this film just be prepared to be hit hard with the unpleasant parts of the human condition."

However, since the beginning, Dan made it clear it was just a weekend affair as he loved his wife and Alex accepted it.

Didn't she try to kill Beth twice, first by kidnapping her daughter, and second, by attacking her on the bathroom?

Redmayne and Chastain deliver very subtle but powerful performances, especially the former, who is just a delight on the screen. But who am I kidding - all performers here were more than good.  Tobias Lindholm and Krysty Wilson-Cairns make for a great director-screenwriter duo. The narrative is very tightly woven, and the setup-payoff rule is utilized brilliantly even. The good cinematography is also due to the direction, and of course the way Lindholm drives performances makes them hit that much harder.  I don't know what theme you'll uncover as an all-encompassing motif of the story, but I'll tell you this: for me, it was negligence. Who knows, maybe you'll get the same results after watching.

On his computer, the police found that he called pedophiles the ,scums of the Earth (true).   This inspired a French filmmaker named **Marc Bisaillion** to make a film named **L'mour** or in English, **With Love**, which won the Canadian original screenplay, achievement in overall sound, and performance by a supporting actor role in some film fest. (However it's just 6.4 on IMDB ;\\~;)  I would greatly appreciate if anyone could comment with any information about this film because information about it on the internet is quite scarce.

My daughter is sick this week and staying home from school. She asked if I would watch a movie with her and of course I agreed.  I thought I'd just be on my phone a bit while she watched but it almost immediately sucked me in.  The characters are so sincere and genuine. I loved the grace Anna's two main care takers showed her. Their response to her behavior is something every parent could learn from.  The relationships that Anna is capable of forming at such a young age are something that I, at 40 years old, have struggled with. Her confidence in herself despite feeling so hopeless is inspiring.  I guess I hope that everyone who reads this post will rush out and view this film. You won't regret it.

The lead actors, Naomi Watts and Edward Norton, have impeccable chemistry and really bring the characters to life. Second, the story is incredibly interesting. It's a complex tale of love, betrayal, and redemption that will keep you hooked from beginning to end. Finally, the film is beautifully shot. The visuals are stunning, and the film's overall aesthetic is simply gorgeous.  If you're looking for a great movie to watch, The Painted Veil is a perfect choice.

Then it got me thinking, are there any other films that have come out in the last 20 years that were “hilarious” when they first came out but are now crossing a line? I use “20 years” because there's obviously a lot of examples of films released before this that wouldn't stand today!  I think American Pie is another good example!

        "body": "I read the Mortal Engines Quartet by Philip Reeve in high school and I LOVE THEM. It may partially be nostalgia, but I contend they're some of the best books of their era (ironically coming out well before the YA dystopia craze by about four years or so).  While the the central premise of a post-apocalyptic steampunk/dieselpunk world where cities move around and consume each other is extremely silly, it's a unique setting that sets it apart from the countless teen dystopias that came after it. In addition, it's got some surprisingly great character work with a romance that feels believable and an undead immortal cyborg assassin that ends up being of the most interesting characters in the entire series (I can't believe I just said those words).  So when I heard a movie was being made from the first book, I was overjoyed. And WETA Workshop was doing the effects! I was beyond hyped!   Then the reviews came out in 2018 and they were mostly negative. Then the movie bombed hard, leaving sequels unlikely.   Then again, I should've seen the signs. One of the trailers shows the main heroine, Hester Shaw, who's supposed to have a gnarly scar across her face. But in the trailer she's shown with a scar that's *kinda* on her cheek, but nowhere near as awful as it's described in the book. That wasn't a good sign.  Then I saw the movie on Tubi just a few days ago.  No wonder it bombed. Dear GOD the studio screwed this one up so bad. Literally SO MUCH was changed that there was no conceivable way they were ever going to get something good.  (Spoilers for anyone who hasn't read the books)  I mean barring Hester's scar, they blow up Airhaven not FIVE MINUTES after arriving there, the entire climax is literally just the ending to a New Hope, the setting is implied to be a couple thousand years instead of 10,000 which would make Shrike make sense, they also just turned Valentine into a generic villain when he was more a lackey doing his job for the REAL villain of the first book who was running London and thus COMPLETELY robbed him of any layers he had.  And probably worst of all, LONDON DOESN'T BLOW UP AT THE END.  That was probably one of the most important aspects of the ending of that first book: the fact that the big enemy city was also full of innocent people. It gave the ending consequence, a real weight to what just occurred. It highlighted how the leaders of London's hubris led to utter disaster that cost thousands of people their lives. It was surprisingly dark for a book aimed at children, but it treated the subject with maturity and the weight it deserved.   The only neat parts were undoubtedly Shrike and the effects in general. They realize the world so well, but it's all in service of a story that's so compromised and stripped of any life or personality.   In addition, it's just so *lifeless*. The books had a quirky charm that reminded me of Terry Gilliam's films, a mix of whimsy and knowing darkness. This movie is so bland and filled to the brim with cliched lines and scenes that I found myself saying roughly what would happen and being spot on.  Good God. I'm so disappointed and sad. At least the books still exist. And the clips of Shrike are amazing.  But you did it, Universal. You made the closest film you can get to Warhammer 40,000 for kids...  and you made it BORING.  \\*slow clap\\* Good for you."

This is a tiny selection of commonly mentioned movies that I could think of. I'm sure there are better examples.  So, would you rather have a movie which has a satisfying arc in which your favourite character survives and the good guys win, or a movie which sticks to what actually happened at the expense of entertainment?  Also, should movies be able to say based on true events when very few (sometimes almost none) of the events actually happened? Should there be a disclaimer that key events or facts are fabricated?  Are there any historical movies out there that stick to truthful events as much as possible and are as entertaining as they could have been with a few tweaks? Personally I find enjoyment in knowing what I'm watching actually happened, but perhaps in in the minority."

As a farm kid who wished to be from a city, it always felt nice seeing them struggle with things I knew how to do.  Fast forward to 2022 and now I'm seeing the adult version of the film. It's a mid life crisis, finding what matters to you, film. I completely forgot about the motivation behind them three male characters. You have the one feeling trapped, forced into a job he doesn't love anymore, feeling his age and realizing what's left. Then you have the pushover, who's taken abuse for years from his wife, loses everything cause he cheats, but eventually learns that, just because you need up doesn't mean it's over and that you can always start acting like the operation you want to be, a do over. Then you have the eternal playboy. Never wanting to settle down and now that he has, he is worried that he will miss having variety pack breakfast now that he's picked his favorite.

I'll finish the movie tonight but I wish it'd be over already. There's no value watching that. I understand we all have different taste and definition of quality movie but maybe Memoria isn't for me.

Did they not also try to escape when they found out the truth? I'd like to know what Alice did after she escaped the simulation. I mean, wouldn't her husband's corpse be lying right beside her as she woke up? Would those red guys in the simulation still be chasing after her even after she re-entered the real world?

QT writes:   ”Even Paul Schrader—in regard to Travis Bickle—slightly invests in this type of character Tom Foolery by suggesting Travis is a Vietnam veteran, and that he did a tour of duty during the war. Horseshit.No fucking way was Travis in Vietnam. The extent of Travis' paranoia of black males is only credible if they are an other that he has only had superficial contact with. How do you do a tour of duty in Vietnam and only have superficial contact with black dudes? The answer is you can't. Okay, say he did serve with black dudes in Vietnam, does that mean he has to like 'em? No, not necessarily. But it's not convincing he would fear them the way Travis does. In the movie, he fears them as an other. If you serve in war with six or seven black guys (officers and enlisted men) they wouldn't be an other (unless, possibly, if Travis was an MP). I don't have a problem with Travis' fraudulent claim in the movie.   The only proof the movie offers up of Travis' military service (no Vietnam flashbacks) is his account to Joe Spinell and his jacket. Fine, Travis spends the entire movie demonstrating to the audience that he's an unreliable narrator, completely delusional, and he constantly presents himself to characters in a fraudulent manner (usually to get something he wants at the moment).  He bought the jacket in an Army Navy Store.”  \\- Quentin Tarantino. ”Cinema Speculation”   What are some other arguments or counter-arguments to this?"

        "body": "That was probably one of the most fascinating, thrilling, odd, and fucked-up films I've ever seen with a very confusing ending that I might need help understanding. So, in spirit of all this, I'm not gonna do a normal review. I'm gonna just say the thoughts I had while watching this film. Enjoy…  - I honestly would've been fine if this film was just Robert Pattinson raising his child in space. Having Batman as your dad would be actually dope, honestly.  - The music is really weird but I kind of like it, I guess.  - The themes regarding sex and civilization is actually really the most fascinating part about the film, but I just felt like the rape scene was unnecessary after a while. Yeah, sure, it'd be kind of realistic, but like really?! I'd say the same with some of the writing.  - Mia Goth probably should win an award for the most odd and fucked-up filmography. She literally has the most fucked-up death scenes in history. Like, yo! However, like what the fuck did she think was gonna happen? 😂  - Also, Mia Goth and Juliette Binoche are both really disturbing and crazy characters that were entertaining to watch, but also made me feel really bad for some of the more normal passengers like André 3000.  - The actress playing the teenage Willow was bad. Sorry, but I couldn't give her a pass. Especially being paired up next to the Pat-man.  - The story is very cool, and the minimal design of the space station was great. Although, the space psychics were very non-consistent.  - I don't know what that ending was about. Like at all. It looked cool, but ok.  But overall, I honestly didn't hate it at all but the more subtle moments and the good stuff outweighed the oddly pretentious and needlessly weird shit.  What did you guys think about this film?"

The main character is the character who:  * the story is about * gets the most screen/page time * the audience has the strongest connection with/ we experience the story with or through them  The hero is the character who:  * the audience roots for, wants to win, or save the day * usually strong, brave, noble and does the right thing * faces the villain or bad guy in the end  The protagonist is the character who:  * changes (or fails to change) over the course of the story * has a want or a need at the beginning of the story that drives the plot * makes decisions or takes actions that determine the plot"

First of all, the slow pace and the cinematography really spoke to me right now…I'm apparently in a phase of wanting these slow-burn, brilliantly acted, simple premise films.  Also, Harry Dean Stanton has always been a favorite actor of mine, whether it be in Repo Man or Twin Peaks: Fire Walk With Me. Seeing him in such a heavy, understated yet complex role really works. But the entire cast is great.  Also, I love “road movies,” and this is certainly is one. Literal shots of traversing America's South Western highways. Big emphasis on signs and architecture.  Without giving away too much of the already relatively simple plot, I highly recommend this movie.   Simplicity and humbleness abound in this quiet masterpiece."

As much as they can be compared, they can't.   However, I saw the original in the FACT cinema, and the remake, reboot, or what I'm gonna call translation, at the Odeon. Both were epic experiences, but the Fincher version just had a bigger budget, more production and a great cast.   If Craig had had the time to perfect the Swedish accent, I'm sure that it would have been a nigh-on perfect translation. He said that some Swedes speak English perfect. I agree. But you can't tell me that the time element didn't play a factor in this decision to keep his accent as as he had the most lines, and he had just come off the back of Bond. That's a lot of work?  Nonetheless, the Fincher version has a few various thematic layers that I enjoyed, and the pictures, mood and music are just a few reasons I think that the Fincher version tops it. For me, it just blends together better, even the long-winded final act.   Interestingly, I am watching it now on Great Movies! and there is an interesting moment I remember picking up on in the cinema.   When Blomkvist (Craig), first has moose with Martin Vanger, there is a sound that makes Blomkvist and Liv? turn to their left (in respect to the shot), whereas Martin looks right.   Martin reacts as if there is a door open, and there may be, but if you really listen, it sounds like a scream.   I thought this was great depth, because I believe that Blomkvist and Liv are hearing, or what they think is wind, whereas Martin is hearing Irina?   Martin later tells Blomkvist that he had an immigrant whore in the basement whilst he and Liv were eating moose.   I told my mate in the cinema. He said Nah. He then turned to his 60 year old mum and 80 year old nan and asked them if they heard it. They both said no.   Yes, my best friend thought it wise to take me and his mum and nan to see this film in the cinema.   Maybe I heard what I wanted as I knew about Martin having seen the original. It was an interesting little detail that was far too delicate to be in a Fincher film without reason.   But, using whatever metric, which one did you favour?"

        "body": "Started thinking about this a lot because black panther 2 is coming out soon and I was wondering if Ryan Coogler will continue his streak of fantastic movies, as I consider him to have one of the best streaks of any filmmaker. So I thought I should look at who he's up against. It's pretty common to do this with musicians to measure consistency and when someone's best era was. Although it seems a lot harder to get a good steak for films cause there's a lot more variance and lack of control for any 1 film maker then for musicians.  Here's what I've come up with after looking through letterboxd a bunch.  S tier: best of the best First for the ones that I've seen enough to be sure -  I would consider Ryan Coogler up here, fruitvale station, Creed, and black panther is a pretty insane run imo.  Another that I think is probably a shoe in for number 1 would be Miyazaki, you could pick a lot of 3 streaks or even 4 streaks that are hard to compete with for him but Princess Mononoke, spirited away, and howls moving castle is probably his best. I have trouble thinking of anyone that can really compete with that. I would also put Brad Bird with the iron giant, the Incredibles, and ratatouille here. Probably add Pete Doctor as well for up, inside out, soul, although I could see people preferring to have the streak with monsters inc for him. I would also say George Lucas as a writer doing a new hope, Raiders of the lost arc, then the empire strikes back would be worthy of this tier. As for the ones I haven't seen all of them yet -  I haven't seen clockwork orange yet but if it's anywhere near as good as people say then Dr. Strangelove, 2001, clockwork has got to give Stanley Kubrick a good placement. Also while maybe not everyone loves his movies, I've got to imagine Synecdoche, Anomolisa, and I'm thinking of ending things is a legendary run (haven't seen anomolisa or synecdoche yet). Or you could switch I'm thinking of with eternal sunshine if you prefer.  A tier: still really impressive. I've seen all of them - Dennis Villeneuve deserves to be here for blade runner 2049, arrival, and dune. Although maybe Sicario and prisoners are good enough to be a better 3 film run (haven't seen them). Depending on what movies of his count I'd say Edgar Wright with Shaun of the dead, hot fuzz, and Scott pilgrim is solid stuff. Although I'll see if I prefer worlds end to Shaun when I get to it. Wes Anderson should definitely be here for Grand Budapest, Isle of dogs, and the French dispatch. But that does depend on how good moonrise kingdom is which I haven't gotten to yet. I would put Jordan Peele up her for get out, us, and nope. I'd also personally put James Gunn for guardians 1, 2, and the suicide squad. Also Taika Waititi deserves a nod for his solid 4 run of what we do in the shadows, hunt for the wilder people, Thor Ragnarök, and JoJo rabbit. Although the idk whether I prefer the 3 run with rabbit or with shadows. For ones I haven't seen all yet - Stephen Spielberg definitely deserves something but his great films are just a little to broken up for a s tier choice.  Francis Ford Coppola should probably be here to for something around godfather 2 and apocalypse now, but I haven't seen apocalypse now and idk anything about the conversation. Ridley Scott probably deserves something for the duelists, alien, blade runner, although I haven't seen alien or the duelists. Same with James Cameron for t2, true lies, titanic, although I haven't seen enough of his movies to say if that's his best run or even a great one. I'd also say Matt Reeves, Robert Eggers, Alfonso Cuaron, Paul Verhoeven, and Martin Scorsese could be here but I haven't seen enough their films to say.  Finally the funniest ones imo are the ones that just barely don't have a great film run. Guillermo Del Torro is here imo, he's one of my favorite film makers but all of his best films are separated by his just fine ones. Andrew Stanton has Finding nemo, Wall-E, and then John Carter lol. Henry Selick almost did The nightmare before Christmas, James and the Giant Peach, and Coraline, but he mad something called monkey bone in between that ruined it lmao. I think Lord and Miller as well as Ryan Johnson deserve shout outs, Johnson has looper, the last jedi, and knives out, but I haven't seen looper and in general whether that's a good run or not seems pretty controversial. Lord and Miller are hard to pin down just cause ordering their movies into a streak is difficult, like I think the lego movie, 22 jumpstreet, and into the spiderverse is the best one they have but that requires jumping between them as writers and directors. And finally, the funniest one, my sweet prince M. Night Shamalan. He was off to a great start with the sixth sense and unbreakable, but then he released signs and never recovered.  I'm curious who I've missed and who other people's picks are for the best or just very impressive ones. I had to limit myself a little cause I don't want this post to be to long and I only have so much time to research haha.  Edit. For the people saying I've answered my own question. Totally understand and my bad yeah, I put a lot of thought into the question before posting and wanted to hear other peoples thoughts, which I thought was common on this server lol. But yeah next time I have a question I'll keep my input brief."

Anything that would be fun to experience in real time if you had no idea it was coming.  An example: imagine you knew nothing about (the original) Jumanji. You would think you were watching a coming-of-age movie about a kid in the late 60s. His dad is really hard on him. He's dealing with bullies at school. He has a crush on a classmate. But then he finds the game, and starts playing it with the girl, and he gets sucked in to the game! And all of the sudden we go 26 years in the future! And Robin Williams is in it! Battling jungle animals! If you knew nothing but the title, that would be a pretty wild ride.  Looking for movie titles only, don't need to explain why it fits the list. For any movies I haven't heard of before, I am going to add them to my to-do list and try to watch them without finding out anything additional about it. Thank you!

        "body": "*My Policeman* was released on Prime Video Friday, 11.4.22. There was a fair bit of chatter when the early reviews came out but not much now that we can actually see it. I had little to do on Friday and was curious, so I watched it.   Here's the review, starting with the thing everyone was talking about early.  Harry Styles is not a good actor. All the early criticisms of his performance are completely deserved. His skills are completely undeveloped to carry a film like this, and many scenes feel bewildering as a result of the choices (or lack of choices) he makes as an actor. He doesn't yet know how to use small actions, vocal inflection, uncomfortable silences, or anything else more practiced actors use to externalize the character's internal state. The audience is left watching a blank slate move between emotional outbursts. It is undeniable the movie would have been better with a more skilled actor imbuing the character with more ***anything.***  It is also undeniable that the movie would have only been marginally better with a more skilled actor playing Styles' Tom.   *My Policeman* is just not a good movie. The script is a mess, including older and younger versions of the characters for no real purpose. The main thrust of the story could have just as easily been handled in one time period. Seemingly important motivations are brought up once, dropped and never addressed down the road (one of the only justifiable reasons for including older versions of these characters would be to have them discuss these things). And dialogue vacillates between relying entirely on the actors to communicate the truth behind what's being said, and outright telling the audience how the character feels or another is reacting.  The direction is equally messy, with at least one choice made to focus the camera on the wrong character during a scene (a minor supporting character ends up being on screen for an extended period while one of the lead's viewpoint is shaken and motivated to change their ways). And a few of the sex scenes are just choreographed and filmed in such a way that it's hard to discern what exactly we're supposed to understand about the characters from these interactions. It's as if the director had no clear vision for what the movie was supposed to be about.  Which is why a better actor would have only made the movie marginally better. David Dawson is the only member of the cast who actually comes away looking good in the film, largely because his character is one of the few given clear motivations and space to explore them. Every other actor's performance is weighed down by the script, direction and editing.  Blame Harry Styles for Harry Styles' poor performance, but *My Policeman* was a disappointment for plenty of reasons outside his control.  **1.5/4**  **TLDR:** Harry Styles is not a good actor, but *My Policeman* is not a good movie, and his performance is exactly what the script and direction deserved."

Goldfinger is probably the best of the bunch, simply because the titular villain has an actual plan.  It actually makes me a little upset that the term “Mary Sue” got coined for female characters in fan fiction in the 1970s and didn't gain mainstream use until it was applied to more female characters in films over the past 10 years or so. There is no bigger Mary Sue in the history of cinema than Bond. And yet he went around inexplicably bedding women and surviving insurmountable odds with no one batting an eye for 60 years.  Anyway, these movies are incredibly dumb. And if anything, rewatching/watching them all in order from the beginning has kind of put me off the character. Also, I now consider Daniel Craig to be BY FAR the best Bond.  Am I about to get downvoted into oblivion?  EDIT: I think it's funny that I've commented before about eating billionaires, but a post about 60-year-old James Bond movies is my *most controversial.*"

But the one thing I absolutely love about the universe how vast and filled with potential story opportunities it is. You can literally make anything and everything in a universe where the size of universe to explore is an entire galaxy, there's a mysterious power called force, technology is extraordinary and there are aliens (technically no one's an alien there but since we're talking from human perspective). A fan fiction can be canon in the universe and still not be closely related to anything that was ever written before.   But what irritates me most is how little the potential is being explored. It's either a prequel, sequel or a spin-off of same story. What about origins of the force? Why there are so less number of sith lords and so many jedi (until order 66) and obviously anything that is remotely not related to force at all. You can write so many quality movies and TV shows and it still won't feel like milking.  I was so excited for sequels but once again reverted back to family drama instead of expanding the scope. It was frustrating. While I like their TV shows (not all) it feels like the entire universe is congested now, especially how things are happening inbetween movies which means we kinda know the ultimate fates. It bugs me so much why they aren't realising the creative potential."

I know that for some this may seem a really obtuse question, it is just that for years this sort of notion has been stuck in my head.  Notably about Merlin (1998) which I consider a 3h epic, and easily my favourite 'filme' so that I have a hard time not thinking in regards to it being a movie. Since as a kid I had a tendency to watch it all in one sitting, same with the 10th Kingdom (another old favourite of mine, though it doesn't rank nearly as high as Merlin 1998 in my esteem), though as an adult I don't have as much time for watching mini-series all in one bang, I have difficulty shaking myself out of my early mindset regarding these flicks.  Though under this supposition I suppose it would make the 10th Kingdom the longest movie in all of history. The problem with that I guess, is that if all were to consider it a movie, it might inspire some directors towards making longer and longer movies (heavens I don't want that! I can barely last through 1h40movies let alone the now very common 2h40 long movies.  It is also that I find that one major difference that separates mini-series from proper tv series is that the latter tend to have multiple seasons, and have a tendency towards stretching out quite a bit. In turn mini-series as I tend to think of them, tend to be fairly self-contained though at the longest they stretch to between 6 hours and 7 hours long. At the shortest they seem to be around the 3 hour mark.  Am I over-thinking this whole thing or just being silly?  What do you all think? Mini-series = movies, or just very self-contained television series?"

I think that's huge in part to it's acting, storytelling, music, cinematography and great character building.  The best example I can think of is Avatar. Was it literally the the highest grossing film ever? Absolutely. But I think you'd be disingenuous if you sat there and told me the writing and the acting was top notch....not even close. The same story had been told dozens of times through different lenses and there was nothing about the acting that screamed Oscar's. Yet Avatar is one of the most incredible movie experiences ever made. Visually it's absolutely stunning. The world-building is unfathomably beautiful and the music makes every scene that much more memorable. I can't wait for the sequels. Even if the stories are subpar it's more than worth the watch...it's a journey."

From here they have powers that they can start using for little things like building legos, but eventually they get so skilled with them they can move cars and stop themselves from harm. Just like building a tolerance. Eventually the metaphor literally becomes them flying, which results in them almost getting hit by a plane aka pushing it too far. These kids are clear drug abuse cliches throughout the entire movie.  When the dad finds the video camera he says, “you think those guys are your friends!? They are losers!” Sounds exactly like a drug talk to me, he even calls the kid a disappointment right after. The kid was clearly recording them high. The dad also claims the kid stole money from him as well.  It was so glaringly obvious while watching the movie, I think everyone should give it a rewatch because it makes it even better."

I just went back and rewatched the trailer and dear god I do not remember the CG being that bad/weird. Anyway, i did a little googling and I can't believe so many people are saying The Muppet version is the best! I never really cared for The Muppets, and while I had heard of this movie, it wasn't on my radar and I just thought it was a silly little movie with no substance. Boy, I guess I'm wrong lol.   And it also hit me that even though I believe I've only seen the one adaptation in theaters 13 years ago, I have always known the elements and basic gist of the story. I'd say it's the most widely known Christmas story ever. What's not to love about the ghosts of Christmas past, present, & future?! I'm ashamed to admit I watched the comedy with Matthew McConaughey a few years back about ghosts of girlfriends past & had a decent laugh.   I really couldn't believe there are so many different versions of this story adapted to the screen, and in terms of a “real” one, like, not featuring Muppets lol, there's no definitive answer on which is the best/most faithful adaptation. The answer is resoundingly, The Muppets. Lmfao.   I'm 27 and I'm very seriously considering renting The Muppet version now. Is The Muppet version your favorite? And if so why should I watch it at my geriatric age? Am I being a Scrooge? If not, what other versions do y'all like/recommend?  Edit: I'm fucking stupid and I meant ultimate instead of penultimate lmfao. Thanks Ya'll!   Edit 2: YES EVERYONE, PENULTIMATE MEANS SECOND TO LAST. Some of y'all are fucking *ruthless*. I'm just trying to talk muppets dammit! Lol  Edit 3: I'M WATCHING THE MUPPET VERSION RN AND OMG. It's *wonderful*. I love The Muppets as characters, Gonzo & Rizzo are hilarious, the sets are beautiful, lighting is amazing and somewhat spooky, and I can't sing enough praises for Michael Caine's performance. Scrooge just met the ghost of Marley & Marley and I can tell this is going to be a favorite of mine for all Christmases to come."

        "body": "So, let's imagine, an alternate universe.  Let's imagine if Spielberg hired Francis Ford Coppola (still in his 80s and 90s director-for-hire period after the failure of One From the Heart) to direct Schindler's List, based off the fact of, you know, Coppola made four of arguably the greatest American films ever made. And all in a row, too!  Let's not speculate on why this happened in this universe (though Scorsese actually WAS the original choice to direct. Polanski was on the short list as well).  What creative choices do you think Coppola would have made with his version of the film? What stylistic choices do you think would be evident in Coppola's version?  I suspect Coppola's film would have been a bit less of an uplifting morality play. I'm also guessing the staging and camera movements would be a lot closer to the classicism of the Godfather, versus the mix of Speilberg-isms and documentary style cinematography seen in the actual film."

Friday night, I tossed on Cape Fear (1991) and enjoyed it for the most part. Some of the editing and sound effects were goofy (I assume intentionally, but I'm not really sure why). Really chilling and entertaining de Niro performance. If you haven't seen it, he has a Southern accent here. Absolutely wild. Nick Nolte is also great, and I've always loved Juliette Lewis.   Saturday night, I watched The Age of Innocence (1993). This might not be for everyone, as it's a stuffy romance drama, but that stuff is right up my alley. I'd definitely recommend it if you like Barry Lyndon, it has very painterly cinematography as well, to say nothing of the stellar performances throughout. I absolutely loved the ending.  Finally, watched Casino (1995) in two sittings today, and had a blast. This is definitely, like, Scorsese-by-numbers chronicling the rise and fall of a couple of criminals played by Robert de Niro and Joe Pesci. Regardless, I'm hard pressed to find somebody who makes these better, and even at 3 hours it was a great time.   Got any thoughts on these three movies? Which is your favorite? Quite a genre whiplash going between them, but it was a very enjoyable time."

Never really gave too much thought into Jake's future though. \\\\  I've seen fan theories that I mostly agree with. He must have ended up keeping the money and staying quiet, purely out of protection for himself and his family. I doubt that would have really kept him out of danger though. Some very high up people knew that he knew about them accepting bribes and what really went down. My guess is, if they really chose to let him live, Jake would have no choice but to flat out resign from the police department.   We see him last walking towards the door of his house, looking beaten and battered, and still had his gun drawn. The news report told nothing about the mob killing of Alonso so of course the higher ups made sure that was covered up. But if they're willing to go to those lengths, realistically, they would have just done away with Jake right?  Alonso's crew already didn't like him, they probably wouldn't need much extra incentive to kill him.   What do you think? Is there a scenario where Jake actually continues living after the day's events?"

Frank-N-Furter has been embraced by lots of LGBT+ people, but isn't he an insane, murderous psychopath? I don't understand if he's supposed to be a positive or negative depiction of transvestites, to use this movie's term.   What's the deal with Rocky? I get that he's supposed to be an analogue for Frankenstein's monster, but he doesn't seem to contribute anything to the story. He's just a sexual object with the personality of a child being literally groomed by a transvestite, which also doesn't seem like a charitable depiction of trans people. He's consistently depicted as an innocent victim of the castle's uninhibited residents, but this is mostly treated as something comical.

You'll often find it at 2nd place (under the original, of course) when ranked among the other films in the franchise…though I realize that isn't saying much.  The film manages to remix some of the elements that made the classic original so timeless without feeling like a redundant retread. Adrien Brody's anti-hero mercenary is the physical inversion of Arnold's brick house solider. Instead of being a group of trained grunts on a rescue mission the supporting characters represent the dregs of human society who have, in essence, been condemned in more ways than one.  This brings me to my favourite line in the film. Brody's lethal determination to escape brings him face to face with a chained Predator; he wants to enlist the aid of the creature. His motivation is simple and summed up thusly:  “I want off this planet”  And therein lies the irony; it's often something so many of us say of our own planet when we observe the cruelty and evil that mankind is capable of. And yet Brody and this colourful band of lowlifes represent the worst of humanity; the very reasons so many of us “want off this planet”.  I often think of this line, as it is a fun little nuance in a film that is filled with them. It's still a very overlooked gem, and I think it represented the potential this franchise once had (thankfully PREY managed to salvage some of that)."

I personally think that the character designs aren't exactly that hard to replicate into live action characters and there are definitely some actors and actresses that could look similar if they choose well and with a good budget for the movie, the effects and action scenes could be really good and accurate to their abilities.  I've always thought that the first incredibles movie was definitely more of a spy movie rather than s super hero movie (or at least a spy movie that just happens to have super heroes in it acting primarily as spies);and that is part of what makes it great (including the music, which I think is definitely inspired by common background music used for spy related shows and movies).

But even he admitted that he might be way off and it might just be a bunch of cobbled together action sequences.   What did you guys think of it?  The movie generally got bad reviews from critics, and audience members.  Yet it still has it's fans."

Thriller? Shades of the continuous rising tension recently seen in 'Uncut Gems' can be seen here as well in the 2nd half.  A strong attribute of TD is that it is unpredictable. So many movies can be predicted by midway but not TD. You can never predict how the plot will resolve when this cursed day ends. And what a day it is for Alonzo & Jake. What starts out as a usual cop routine turns into a bloody, chaotic mess by the end.   In between the two enter into a bond. A bond which starts off as Jake sees Alonzo as an inspiration and by the end he doesn't even deem him worthy of giving him an extra minute of his time.  Full marks to David Ayer for writing a strong script with great dialogue and convos, nice incorporation of LA backdrop and a plot that takes right beats all the time.  I do like most Antoine Fuqua movies but this is clearly his best. Full credit to him for making a film mostly about 2 characters and set only in a few places seem epic and larger than life.  If you need an example of where a top class actor hugely elevates a film, TD won't be a bad one. Denzel is FIRE in each scene. You cannot take your eyes off him for a second. he commands every scene. Very few actors could pull off the swagger of Alonzo the way Denzel does. One is compelled to hate him by the end, but Denzel gives such an electric performance that you just hope to see a bit more of his Alonzo.  Full marks to Ethan Hawke as well who held his own against that monster performance and became the moral compass of the film. Purely good, morally upright characters become boring most times but Hawke portrayed innocence which really sells Jake as a character to the audience and root for him.  73% on RT and 7.7 on IMDb are respectable scores but I thought it deserves at least 80% ratings.  My rating is **9/10**."

Anyone who has even a passing understanding of spelunking, caving, or even climbing was on the end he of their seat in the middle portion of the movie. If you want to  know what should have been the real monster in this movie, Google “Nutty Putty Cave Incident”. Or not, if you don't like staring the horrors of hubris in the face of natures cold indifference in the face. Your bag.   There were so many brilliant moments of the real toll of survival sports. There's the moment Holly gets disoriented seeing phosphorus and we watch in helpless horror as she stares down the barrel of the camera in a sentiment of “I'm going to fall. It's going to hurt”. There's the death-defying cam-bolted crack climb over the ravine and agonizing rope burns that stymie a character for the rest of the movie. And of course there's the moment Sarah gets stuck in a tunnel and Juno comes and helps her, and the two of them have a close, deep moment where the main character has to just sit, in her trauma, in the place she doesn't want to be, and wait for her breathing to cool down. Anyone who has had a panic attack in a time where the panic attack made the thing causing the panic attack worse, knows the futility of trying to calm down so you can get somewhere less dangerous. Bodies don't work like that and it sucks ass.   All of these made for piss your pants scary content. I'm sure that having some experience and interest in rock climbing made the content a little more interesting for me than if I didn't, but I can't imagine anyone seeing those moments and not having their stomach drop into their taint.   And then they had to go and add monsters. Suddenly, gone were the slow burn moments of physical activity that might once have been fun and cathartic for our crew, but were being recast in their hearts as traumatic and painful. Gone was the use of real gear and skills that made me feel like the movie was made as a melancholy love song to the sport I love. Gone were all the things that made this movie special and made the setting intriguing and unique. The second the monsters were introduced, the setting and particular challenges of that setting took a complete back seat, and they could have been in a locked house in the middle of nowhere, or a wooded hillside, or any other poorly lit horror trope for all it mattered(I'm not even going to start on the lighting). It was just “girls run from scary monsters and interpersonal drama ensues”. Oh. How novel.  The interpersonal drama, while we're on it, about her affair and who abandoned who was also obnoxious and useless, it was just there to provide cheap character development beats and move the story along. Not a scrap of it touched the emotional depth of the line “the worst thing that could have happened to you already happened, and you're still here”, which happens in what I consider to be the emotional climax of the entire movie, and which happens pre-monstypoo.   All in all I just have never had a movie hit so hard in the exposition and scene setting, and then flop so hard in the revelation of actual premise. It reinforced the ever-present  reliance on jump scares in the horror industry, as a movie that, had it stuck to its guns, wouldn't have needed a single one. It came so close to having the conflict be “man vs wild” with no animals, a conflict typically reserved for thrillers and action flicks, and then abandoned it.   It wasn't even bad. I left it going “ooooh spooky”, because adrenaline is a helluva drug, and only really noticed my issues with it as I was lying in bed that evening. But notice them I did, and I just can't look at it as good because I can only see how much better it could have been. It failed hard for me and I understand I'm the minority here since everyone loved it but I needed to put my grievance down on paper and see how others felt."

        "body": "TLDR: Baby Driver prequel idea revolving around Doc, how he built his career in crime, and his love story (yes, without Kevin Spacey)  Hi all!  Recently I became overwhelmed with one idea that came to me out of nowhere: a prequel to Baby Driver (later abbreviated as BD).  Now by that I don't mean a movie with Baby stealing cars as a kid and doing all the jobs for Doc, because even though it could be fun in its own way, an impactful climax to such a story could be hard to pull off in a meaningful way considering where the already existing story picks up. What I had in mind was a movie following Doc's story.  I believe there are quite a few of Doc's plotlines worth following that were, or were not, mentioned in BD, with the main one being, obviously, how Doc has managed to rise to a criminal mastermind on such a scale. Since in BD we're already dropped into what I think we can consider Doc's prime, exploring how he had built his network seems like an interesting story. But the fact that, clearly, he couldn't have done it alone, it brings me to my next point: the love story.  I think this whole idea originated when I started thinking about a particular Doc's line in BD - I was in love once. With such a cold delivery, and how impactful it was on the BD story, one could only wonder what Doc had been through. My idea would either be that Doc's second half was either his main accomplice in building the crime empire that we know with Doc eventually losing them in a job-gone-wrong (might be too similar to Buddy-Darling plot though), or that they were the person trying to pull him out of his crime life, but with Doc sticking to it in the end and his love interest walking away from him because of that (they could die too, but that's just lazy writing). Despite the former perhaps having a more unusual quality to it, the latter would make more sense as to why Doc decided to help Baby and Debbie in BD.  Other plotlines I thought were worth, at least, touching upon include e.g., where bananas came from, but most importantly: how Doc met Baby. Since, from BD, we know that Doc had first encountered Baby when he was stealing his car (and a lot of merch inside) when Baby was a kid, that encounter could at least be included as a closing scene in the movie, perhaps followed by Doc finding him and hiring in a post-credit scene. The Doc-Baby mentoring arc is definitely worth exploring; however, it seems to me that it could be too much for one movie, and hence it would not seem fitting to get too much into that plotline initially (also: see the second paragraph).  The last thing I want to touch upon is what is quite possibly the quality most associated with BD - the music. Since it would not be Baby's movie, the music definitely need not be the driving force of the movie, especially not to an extent where the scenes were synched to the beat (which I loved, don't get me wrong, it just would not serve the purpose of the movie). However, that does not mean that the soundtrack should not be good, because it should be. It is just as important as in every other movie, if not more, since we are staying in the BD universe.  The main issue that comes to mind is that Doc was portrayed by Kevin Spacey, however, since the action would take place 15-20 years before BD, that issue could be easily resolved by not casting Kevin Spacey, hence getting rid of said issue.  In the end I'm not sure whether I'm doing this for a peace of mind, or I actually hope enough people find the idea interesting for it to make a difference (and a movie), but I'll just leave it here and see what comes of it! So thanks if managed to catch your attention enough for you to read that to the end and hopefully there will be some interesting discussions in the comments!"

It would've been perfect if it had ended five minutes earlier, but boy howdy, does it nail the disturbing atmosphere.

About Time (2013)- my guilty pleasure Romance pick that is so much more than just a Romance film.  4. Shaun of The Dead (2004)- I did not want to think about a world where this gem didn't exist so I just had to save it.  5. Gladiator (2000) - couldn't help myself. Gladiator will be the movie I put on when I want to get my testosterone flowing!   What are you saving?  Edit: I have to say I am very satisfied, yet not surprised by how many of you have also saved About Time (2013). It goes to show how strong that movie's message is.  Edit 2: one that got away from me that I would like to add as an honorable mention is The Fall (2008). A truly breathtaking film that is so beautiful and unlike any movie I've seen."

Spoilers: >!The tyrannical king of Qin is invading and conquering territories with his army of archers who lay waste to armies and cities. Jet Li is granted an audience with the king for having killed several of his attempted assassins. As he retells the story to the king, he shares a journey of pursuing and coming to sympathize with the assassins, joining their plot to kill the king. Only by killing all the assassins can he get an audience with the king, and get close enough to kill him with his secret unstoppable move. But why is he confessing this much about their plot to the king himself? Is it because he is that confident in his move? The king is very on edge now. As he finishes the story, we learn one of the last assassins had a change of heart, and he changed Jet Li's mind as well. Jet Li unleashes his attack but stops short, and reveals that the message he was given was “Our Land”. The king cries a tear of joy for finally being understood. Just a misunderstood subjugator. He has Jet Li killed anyway. The end.!<  These themes that I once saw as harmless seem increasingly distasteful to me. Anyone else think about this movie?"

Back in the 50's there was some altercation with the owner or owners family. So there was a group of guys in the garage and one of them was beaten with a hammer.  Clearly as a kid the most gruesome part is what I remember the most and after hearing about Pelosi's husband - it sort of brought the memory to the surface.

Here is my guess at the time line:   June 9, 1944: Miller gets his orders to search for Ryan. He finds Upham and attaches him to the patrol.   June 10: Patrol sets out at first light.  Arrives in Neuville. Death of Caparzo. Patrol spends night in Church and leaves just after dark. This is the only time we see the patrol at night resting/sleeping.   June 11: Patrol arrives at Glider crash site and moves on to attack the radar site. Wade is killed. At the end of that scene the sun is clearly going down.   June 12:  Here is where things get confusing. The very next scene after the radar site the patrol is back to marching across Normandy. We, the audience is not shown if the patrol stopped for the night or kept going. Miller and his surviving men get in a fight with the German half track and finally find Ryan. We then see Miller organize the defense of Ramelle. My problem is that the whole Ramelle sequence appears to take place in one day in the film.  My guess is that the Rangers and paratroopers worked thru the night of June 12th into June 13.   June 13: I assume that the Rangers and 101st Airborne paratroopers are eating breakfast when the SS show up. Final battle takes place in the morning."

        "index": "0    1  2     3    4      5  6    ",
        "body": " Back in 2005, Pixar's Disney contract was coming up, and they were planning to take their leave. You see, Michael Eisner was President of Disney at the time, and he basically made Pixar's time at Disney, EXTREMELY difficult for them. So, when their ten-year contract was set to expire in 2005, Pixar had full intentions of leaving, since Eisner was still in charge by that point.  However, by some miracle, Eisner ended up being voted out of the company around that time, and was replaced with Bob Iger, who offered to buy Pixar out in their entirety. Pixar agreed, and they've been a staple of Disney ever since then.  But what if that didn't happen? What if Michael Eisner remained president until the end of Pixar's contract, and allowed them to leave?  Well, by that point, the first Cars movie was already complete and ready for theaters. Due to their contract with Disney, Cars would still meet its planned 2006 release date, though by this point, Pixar would be long gone. In its place, would be a brand-new studio called Circle 7 Animation. This was a studio whose entire purpose, would've been to create direct-to-DVD sequels to all Pixar movies released between 1995 and 2006.  Some of their projects would've included an alternate Toy Story 3 (with Buzz being accidentally sent to a Buzz Lightyear factory in Japan, where the gang have to save him), an alternate Finding Nemo 2 (with Nemo being revealed to have a long-lost brother named Remy) and a movie titled Monsters Inc: Lost in Scaridise (where Boo would've moved to a new house, and Sully and Mike would have to door-hop and try to find her new door). These movies probably would've been terrible in all honestly, just like most of the Disney direct-to-DVD sequels were at the time.  As for Pixar, well pretty much every movie studio would be trying to get Pixar under their wing. However, Pixar would probably avoid some of them. Fox would probably be turned down, due to them already owning Blue Sky. Sony would be turned down as well, due to their bad reputation behind-the-scenes. Universal would also likely be turned down, due to their association with DreamWorks (a company that Pixar founder John Lasseter, wasn't a fan of). In the end, the studio that Pixar would most likely decide to work with, would be Warner Bros.  Warner Bros would make Pixar a generous offer to come and be a part of their company. Pixar would agree, on the condition they be allowed to make any movies that they want. Warner Bros agrees; however, they also insist that every other movie Pixar makes, has to be about one of Warner's existing IPs. Pixar agrees, and the deal is finalized in 2007. Their first movie together is Ratatouille, which Pixar managed to make while they were still on the market, due to them using the last of their funds to get the movie made. Warner Bros distributes it for them and it's met with the same critical acclaim that it did IRL.  Now, Pixar has to fulfill their end of the deal, and make a movie about a Warner Bros IP. Pixar decides to make a movie about Scooby-Doo. Warner Bros is okay with this, since the Scooby-Doo reboot series Mystery Incorporated was right around the corner, and this movie would add to the hype. Pixar's Scooby-Doo is released in 2009/10, and scores rave reviews with critics.  Following this, we get this timeline of movies:  * **Wall-E (2011)** * Animated Aquaman (2012) (we never get a sequel, due to Warner wanting to make a live action movie) * **Up (2013)** * Scooby-Doo 2 (2014) * **Brave (2015)** * The Jetsons (2016) * **Inside Out (2017)** * The Iron Giant 2 (2018) (Brad Bird would want to work with Pixar again, and finally get this sequel out, making this Pixar's first 2D animated film). * **The Good Dinosaur (2018)** * Scooby-Doo 3 (2019) * **Coco (2020)** * Jonny Quest (2021) * **Onward (2021)** * DC's League of Super Pets (2022) * **Soul (2022)**  Meanwhile, Disney's Circle 7 division is ultimately shut down in the early 2010's, and Disney instead begins making either big-budget sequels to make up for the cheap ones, or they begin making live action remakes of all of Pixar's movies, starting with Toy Story.  Now, I could imagine that when Pixar's Warner Bros contract is set to expire in 2017, Disney renegotiates with Pixar and offers to buy them out. I could imagine Pixar either going back to Disney or staying with Warner Bros (depending on how Warner would treat them)."

I'm more asking about going from one or two great performances to immediately being slated in multiple blockbusters and major franchises seemingly overnight.   How does someone go from being in, let's just say, less-than-huge movies to suddenly being a huge star in 1 MCU project, slated to be in 3 more, a co-starring role in Devotion with an actor from Top Gun Maverick, and in fucking Creed III, all in the span of like 3 years?

I thought it was fantastic especially being from a Jewish family myself. But I feel it's overrated in reference to fans putting it as tarentinos best. I just can't agree with that. So many put it at #1 in his filmography when personally I find pulp fiction OUATIH reservoir dogs and especially Django all to be better by a good amount. I found IB to be a little slow at times and could be a little boring at certain parts.  2. I don't understand the extreme hype behind Parasite  This is another film I really enjoyed. But I don't understand why it has such a cult following. Like yeah it was good. Great message acting and plot. But why is this the highest rated film on letterboxd? This is not a perfect film and I don't understand why so many put it as the best of all time and a 10/10.  Am I missing anything with these two films?"

He swears to hunt down the people who killed his wife and goes to a detective for help. Since he can't remember things, he takes pictures of people and writes things about them on the photo so as to remember if they are friends or foes. As the movie progresses he tracks down the so-called 'killers' of his wife and proceeds to kill them. Later it is revealed that in actuality, he suffers from memory loss due to an accident and not a attack and that his wife couldn't believe that he couldnt remember things. So she told him to inject her with insulin over and over again until she overdosed and died. They guy made up the stories of an attack as a coping mechanism meanwhile the detective was using him to hunt down and kill criminals or smt. This also wasn't the first time he had killed his wife's 'killers'. He kills the detective and loses his memory so proceeds to look for his wife's killers again.!<  If you recognise this plot, please do tell. I'd appreciate it"

There is a scene, however that brought a lot of controversy with how Mathilda was dressed and was simply teasing Leon inappropriately that seems kind of pedophilia but the way how I perceive it though, seeing how Leon who is known for his Hitman lifestyle and is always alone, busy and serious, maybe she just wanted him to simply open up and start socializing with normal people.

And even at the end, he regretted turning on the bad guys.   Yes, there are moments in the movie where Henry seems to have a heart like his reaction at Spider being killed. But then, he was killing, he was cheating on Karen with Debi Mazar (??).   I wonder if Henry was played by someone like Harvey Keitel, would we still sympathize with Henry. Liotta is such a pretty boy (but a damn fine actor, so underrated)."

The two guys then go into a shop/bank etc, and then visited a vet, and I can't remember what happened but then they got put into these public stocks themselves.  They weren't stocks as we think (such as head and hands from A Knights Tale), but like a neck brace, which was on chains from a wooden tree.

I   remember it may have aired on the Sundance Channel or Independent Film   Channel.  The first scene I   remember was this young woman who was trying to help a passed-out man up   the stairs to their apartment(?) or room(?). It was amusing in that  she  kept struggling, trying all sorts of ways to drag him up.  But he  was  just too heavy. The camera angle was from a bird's eye view, with  her  back showing. It looked like the couple may have come back from a  dance  club or party.  Another  scene  showed a socialite-type couple that was posing for picture. It  may have  been their home or the one of the photographer. Anyhow, I  remember the  photographer getting his tripod camera ready and then  cheerily yelling,  Say cheese! (or it might have been Smile!) before  passing out in  front of them. The couple looked confused.  I think it may have been a black or tongue-in-cheek type comedy. Sorry, I can't recall any familiar actors in the film."

The limited runtime meant that established characters and new characters were fighting for screen time, and in the end this made all the new characters feel underdeveloped making it hard to get invested in them.  Killing off Dewey felt really forced, like the movie was desperate to create some stakes and differentiate itself from the others but it did was in the most obvious way ever: Killing off the most expendable legacy character. Really I think all the legacy characters in this franchise have had too many endings at this point, it was long past time to pass the torch.   The twist is what was really underwhelming though. The killers were EXTREMELY obvious, so much so that the characters even admit it themselves at the reveal, this was really the moment I felt truly let down. I feel like the fourth movie was almost a better try at basically the same thing this film was going for, and had a much better final reveal. I've always said the key to a good plot twist is two elements: it is unexpected AND in hindsight it makes perfect sense,  you have to have both or it just won't work.   Overall the whole thing felt phoned in, and it seemed like instead of trying to be more like the original for nostalgia bait they should've tried to shake up the formula a bit more. At this point the movies have become to formulaic.  Edit: REALLY good idea just came to me about what this movie should've been. In the first film they originally planned to make Dewey one of the killers but never got around to it. What if they started this one off the same but brought that idea back. Gale has left him and Sydney moved away, so what better way to bring them back home than for him to start doing the killings? He originally planned to frame someone else, maybe an accomplice? But is discovered at the climax. Now THAT would've been interesting."

Howard exited the project for the final movie The Dark Knight Rises, and while I don't have an exact quote, I recall him saying something along the lines of this was always Zimmer's baby.  Howard is nothing if not prescient here, as there are few people even among score enthusiasts who could discern a difference between the two scores that Zimmer co-composed and the score he assumed full duties for.  It leads me to wonder: what did James Newton-Howard contribute to the project at all? Now, I'm not saying Howard is a bad composer in the slightest, but considering his absence from the third film making no perceivable difference in that score's quality, it may be something similar to Eminem's guest verses dominating the primary artist.   Batman Begins and The Dark Knight have both Zimmer and Howard as composers, and no priority is given between the two. However, since Zimmer's solo Rises has come out, I am left wondering what exactly Howard contributed to the project's musical identity. Rises was no less for Howard's absence, and Howard himself supposedly admitted to his taking a backseat role in the previous films."

My guess is there was sort of a Batman Forever situation here where the last one was so dark that they swung too far the other way to correct it. It almost reminded me of the Roger Moore era Bond films (ironic given the presence of Sean Connery). I actually enjoy quite a few of those for what they are, but I don't think it quite works with this.  The first two films certainly have humor, but they're fairly serious overall. This one almost tipped over into complete comedy at times. I won't say none of the jokes work, but a lot of it is fairly silly, and while Harrison Ford and Sean Connery are always entertaining, I didn't think the style of humor meshed with their more deadpan personas.  The villains are also really weak. We go from a maniacal super Nazi to a deranged death cult to some random rich guy with an assist from other Nazis that aren't nearly as memorable in my opinion. And Elsa's motivations change on a dime to fit whatever the current scene requires, which I thought was pretty sloppy.  It's certainly far from awful. Spielberg still knows how to direct fun action and as I said the performances and some of the humor work OK, but I thought it was a fairly large step down overall. I do seem to be in the minority on this, however, since I seem to recall that most people like this one. I still haven't watched Crystal Skull yet, but I'm excited to do so since it seems to be pretty universally considered the worst one, so I'm curious if I'll agree."

        "body": "I general, I think Christopher Nolan's use of IMAX cameras in certain scenes elevates those scenes. I think he picks the right scenes to film with the expensive and logistically difficult but supreme quality cameras.   However, there are a few times where the constant change in orientation can be disorienting, and none are more obvious in my opinion than a certain scene in The Dark Knight Rises. I would say it's nearly as jarring as the notorious 27 shot Liam Neeson fence jump in Taken 3. (27 is a number I picked out of my hat, but it was a ridiculously high number for such a simple scene.)  In Dark Knight Rises, at 54:54, the camera transitions back to traditional widescreen after a long action scene filmed entirely in IMAX. The scene proceeds in widescreen until 55:45, where an IMAX shot of the Batcopter (assuming that's what it's called) enters the Batcave, lasts until 55:48, or around 3 seconds. At 55:49, the film reverts to widescreen for the proceeding 5+ minutes.   While I normally welcome the added clarity and extreme detail of IMAX shots and find Nolan's use of such cameras fitting, this scene feels incredibly jarring to me. You go from nearly a minute of widescreen, to just 3 seconds of IMAX, and then back to widescreen all in the span of 60 seconds. Was it really necessary to shoot Batcopter's return to Batcave in IMAX for all of 3 seconds?   I wish movies could be filmed entirely in IMAX. I mean, who doesn't? But I understand the logistical hurdles of doing so, and I appreciate that decisions must be made to put priority over certain scenes. However, filming 3 seconds of Bat-aerial-vehicle flying through a waterfall in IMAX, bookended on both sides by continuous non-IMAX shots doesn't benefit the film.   It only highlights the issues of asymmetry and inconsistency between shots that most viewers ignore because of the immense clarity that IMAX provides, only in this case the benefit is negligible and actually harms the film. It feels incredibly out of place, and makes the film feel janky in that moment.   This is only a minor gripe about a movie that I thoroughly enjoy, but I think it needs to be said."

Indiana Jones is a professor of archaeology at a university. He is very well educated and clearly possesses a ton of knowledge. However, he also has quite a passion for obtaining antiquities. He spends a lot of time travelling around the world and plundering historic sites in order to get what he wants.  His character design is very notable. He wears a fedora, a leather jacket, and uses a bullwhip as a means of conquering obstacles and hampering his enemies. Brilliant character design.  Indiana Jones is a very engrossing character. He's a womanizer, a thief, a rogue, and kind of an asshat, but he also has a good heart and wants to help his friends.  He's brilliantly portrayed by Harrison Ford in what is an absolutely impeccable performance.  In my opinion, Indiana Jones is an absolutely fucking iconic character.  What do you think? Do you disagree? Would you say Indiana Jones is iconic? Is that a silly claim?  I am eager to hear your thoughts!"

His first post-70's Show role was as Eddie Brock/Venom in Spider-Man 3. While the idea of a dislikable Peter Parker lookalike makes some sense, fans of Venom felt it was not the Eddie Brock they wanted. It was also a bit of an over bloated movie in terms of villains, so overall that debut fell flat.   He never seemed to grab a solid leading man role, with most supporting roles in movies as an unlikeable character. A highlight for me is his role in the underrated 'Predators'.  It's crazy to see what seemed like such a well liked tv star to be relegated to these purposefully unlikeable supporting roles in forgettable movies.  What are your examples of something similar?"

While I'm fine with getting to know about the main plot and the vibe of a film, a lot of the time, trailers either give away too much or will present you with something that's completely different from the actual film's tone / plotline. The former happens much more frequently now that production companies upload several different trailers for the same film in order to keep the audience excited. Now they might include important moments, be it a pivotal locations or iconic lines. Doesn't that sort of spoil the surprise?   I just find it quite refreshing to go into it and experience it as it plays, without an expectation of something shown in the trailer. (This has backfired on me before of course; for example, I went into Raw (2016) blind thinking it was a drama about a French girl going to vet school, lol. Anyway...)   Some hardcore comic-book movie fans would avoid any clips or trailers before they see a film, but I feel like that's more rare with other kind of films, especially ones without a cult following (non-franchise movies for example). These fans avoid trailers because they don't want to risk being spoiled with a character reveal or a cameo etc., in order to maximise their viewing experience. Although smaller films might not have very high stakes,  I now feel that avoiding trailers generally elevates my viewing experiences.   TL;DR, what constitutes a good trailer, and what are some examples of good / bad ones? Do you think watching trailers heightens one's enjoyment of the film or slightly dampens it? I would love to hear your thoughts :)   (By the way, I'm not trying to say that people shouldn't watch movie trailers or anything! My opinion is definitely in the minority so I'd just like to see what y'all think 🙂)"

One of these is a technical expert on the subject matter while the other is an influential local official. The first halves of both movies explore the local town, its culture, geography, politics and issues while the second half is all about tackling a monster. In Jaws it is the dang shark whereas in Dante's Peak it is the volcano (a very different kind of threat however).  Of Course Dante is not in the same league as Jaws. One thing that really pulls Dante down is the basic writing. The dialogue never impresses. Another negative is the climax. Being stuck in a rubble and then waiting to be rescued for 20 minutes really killed the momentum they had generated earlier.  The visual effects of DP deserve praise given the time period. The destruction of the volcano and the subsequent effects on the nearby areas was terrifying.  One thing of note in DP is that I really liked the way they showed the working of the scientist/geologist group. Normally science comes across as boring in movies but here I was invested in their research, analysis and the slowly building tension that there is indeed something wrong with the volcano. They should have focused more on that and then show the destruction in the final 30 minutes instead of giving it the full 60 minute treatment.  I do like small town movies as well as disaster movies so seeing a combination of them together in Dante's Peak was a plus for me. I did like the movie and think it's a fun ride from the 90s.

Example of that would be, if you like *Enemy of the State*, you should watch *The Conversation*.  I flaired this as Discussion, because I'm hoping to get some recommendations going. Thanks!"

Insanely well choreographed and shot and. for small to medium budgets the set pieces are really top of the line. The tracking shot in Extraction is one of the best I've seen in years and the best in a action movie I've ever seen. It really seems that the stunt coordinators are really taking over the genre much like the Bays, Tony Scotts, John Mctiernan's Renny Harlins, etc back then in the 80s."

If you don't know what I mean I'm talking about how some people make a short film and submit it to film festivals as a 'proof of concept' for a feature length film. For example: Damien Chazelles whiplash short film was a proof of concept for the feature film and it was just the rushing or dragging scene. Wes Anderson also made a short film and considered it as a proof of concept for his film 'Bottle Rocket'. Now I'm not asking what are some other films that were funded through proof of concepts rather are some scenes from movies that you think could of convinced investors to turn it into a feature. For example I think the first scene of inglorious basterds could have been a short film and would've interested investors if it wasn't coming from an already well proven director. What do you think would have made good short film proof of concepts from other films?  Sorry if this doesn't make sense.  Edit: I misspelled the title. It's meant to be concept not concert."
