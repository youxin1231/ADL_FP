I get that it's the norm a whole decade later in the present, but it at least *looks* like a real place.  The story is incredibly low stakes, with the threat having barely any discussion nor brought up a whole lot. Will Poulter (Adam Warlock in Guardians of the Galaxy Volume 3 next year) is a new character one half of four siblings are stuck with, and he's one of the most annoying characters I've ever seen. Also British. He's turned into a dragon that looks like it's from Disney's Dinosaur. A 10 year older movie. Aslan and Tilda Swinton are on the poster/cover, but their *collective* screentime in the movie add up to barely 5 minutes. Aslan looks like one of those fan corrected designs for The Lion King remake. And the sea looks like the one from Jaws: The Revenge.  Minor characters the movie tries to make seem relevant feel pointless. There's a little girl they want us to try care about and feel happy for near the end, except she's had two scenes and about a minute of screentime.  All in all, this was a snoozefest."

But in ESB, the “No, I am your father” got me laughing because when the camera pans to Luke's horrified expression, he reminded me of a hamster who was shocked it's food bowl was empty.    RoTJ was also funny, mostly because of Emperor Palpatine. He was so over the top evil that I couldn't find him too threatening.   I still like these movies, but in a different way than I think was intended."

I'm thinking of Drive, Taxi Driver, Blade Runner 2049, Good Time, etc etc. Guys generally relate to them because they're an outlet for emotions that they feel society rarely allows them to express.     I know I'm not making any major discoveries here, this genre is mostly an internet phenomenon and these types of films have existed way back since the 30s/40s with the advent of the noir, but that thought just made me hold some newfound appreciation for a series of films that have almost just become a meme whenever they're brought up at this point."

She and Jesse, a boy in her class, soon become friends and begin playing in the woods together, swinging across a creek on a rope that they pretend is a gateway to a magical land. The novel follows the development of their friendship, their time at school, and their adventures in Terabithia, which they keep secret from their families and friends.

I know it costs more money the longer you have digital effects.. but cmon. It's a giant monster movie it's what people are expecting.   Maybe im having revisionist history but I always thought the older Godzilla films, Gorgo, Them, Cloverfield, and such did a much better job at balancing the human and monster scenes.

For Del Toro, he was hardly known yet as the incredible character actor who played with brilliant charm to his character. With the fact that there were massive names on board and such small time to make a mark, he did it with superb style. Honorable mentions go to Donald Sutherland in JFK, he had one exposition dump and did it with astonishing style. In a film that had Gary Oldman, Tommy Lee Jones, Joe Pesci and Jack Lemmon as supporting characters, his one scene taking the entire show away is amazing. Also Abigail Breslin in Little Miss Sunshine, she was 10 and gave a perfomance stronger than everyone in that ensemble, that is insane. What are your choices? Let me know."

        "body": "As a discerning cinephile, I must confess that I find the revered status of The Godfather trilogy to be entirely unwarranted. While it is undoubtedly a well-crafted and expertly acted series of films, its lauded place in the pantheon of cinematic history is, in my opinion, nothing more than a product of hype and nostalgia.  Firstly, the story itself is rather trite and unoriginal. The narrative arc of a young man's rise to power within a crime syndicate has been explored countless times before, and The Godfather offers little in the way of innovation or fresh perspective on the subject. The overly macho and chauvinistic portrayal of its male characters is rather tiresome, and the frequent scenes of gratuitous violence quickly become repetitive and tedious.  Additionally, the cinematography and direction are somewhat unremarkable. While there are certainly some striking visual moments, the overall aesthetic is rather predictable and derivative, failing to push the boundaries of the medium in any meaningful way. Furthermore, the overreliance on close-ups and dialogue-heavy scenes detracts from the visual appeal of the films, making them feel more like stage plays than truly cinematic experiences.  While I do not deny the technical proficiency and acting prowess on display in The Godfather trilogy, I cannot help but feel that its vaunted reputation is greatly exaggerated. It is a competent, if uninspired, crime drama that does little to justify its place among the greatest films of all time.  One of the key factors contributing to the overhyped nature of The Godfather trilogy is its thematic reliance on well-trodden mobster tropes. The narrative of The Godfather is essentially a retelling of the rise and fall of a powerful mafia family, a story that has been told countless times before and since. While Coppola's treatment of this familiar material is undoubtedly skillful, it is not particularly innovative or groundbreaking. Moreover, the film's portrayal of Italian-American culture is reductive and stereotypical, reinforcing negative stereotypes rather than offering a nuanced and complex depiction of the community. The Godfather's depiction of violence and the criminal underworld is deeply problematic. The violence in these films is presented as almost glamorous, with the mafia members depicted as charismatic, intelligent and ultimately justifiable in their actions. This romanticization of organized crime is both disturbing and irresponsible, and does not merit the widespread acclaim that these films have received. The violence in The Godfather is often gratuitous and excessively graphic, which only serves to further glorify.   In conclusion, while I do not deny the technical proficiency and acting prowess on display in The Godfather trilogy, I cannot help but feel that its vaunted reputation is greatly exaggerated. It is a competent, if uninspired, crime drama that does little to justify its place among the greatest films of all time.  TL;DR: The Godfather trilogy is overhyped and overrated because its story is trite and unoriginal, its portrayal of violence is gratuitous and irresponsible, and its direction and cinematography are unremarkable."

My personal favorite is in Netflix's The Week Of when Sandler's character cluelessly invites two random black guys walking by the street outside his house to the family pre-wedding breakfast thinking they are relatives of the black groom. Something about the Office-esque way it's played straight as just a very awkward misunderstanding makes me laugh out loud every time I watch the scene.

        "body": "Ok so this is something that I've been noticing a lot recently, and it probably annoys me far more than it should. It's basically when, in the credits of a movie, a production company or studio is listed more than once.  To give some examples, at the beginning of Godzilla vs. Kong (as well as the other monster verse movies) and Denis Villeneuve's “Dune” the credits read as followed:  “Warner Bros. Pictures and Legendary Pictures present - a Legendary Pictures production”  Other companies I've noticed that do this quite a bit are Lionsgate, Skydance, and Black Label Media.  It annoys the absolute hell out of me. So many movies nowadays have a hundred different studios to credit. Why do companies feel that they need to be listed twice?  Also it just looks stupid in my opinion, especially when the credits literally read like “Lionsgate presents a Lionsgate production”  I don't know. It really shouldn't be that big of a deal but it really irritates me for some reason. Does anyone know why so many companies do this?"

I don't know what it is about this film. But it's still an enjoyable and nearly timeless movie all these years later.  Swayze's character is likeable, and also bad ass when he needs to be.    Also the music didn't hurt the film either. I seem to recall a lot of films in the 80's would have them show off some random band in a bar."

The reason we don't see the Driver's family in Drive is that he became estranged because of their toxicity. After the events of Drive, Barry reconnects with his family, and starts a small business in something mundane. When we meet Barry in Punch Drunk Love, he has a bit of anxiety from almost dying. He's hesitant to talk to and look at, Lena because it reminds him of Irene. The events of Punch Drunk Love show us the Driver finally growing, forgiving himself, and letting go of the regrets from the events in Drive."

(they took co-credit)  The guy who wrote the reshoots won an Original Screen play award and was nominated for a best director Oscar for Spotlight.  The director of photography won an Oscar for La La Land and did No Time to Die and First Man, among others.  And the movie cast includes - Kiera Knightley, Helen Mirren, Morgan Freeman. That is 11 Oscar nominations and 2 wins  All together 14 Oscar nominations and 4 wins among the cast and crew.  And the results? 32% on Rotten. Absolutely beautiful looking film. The sets and cinematography are great. But the story... empty as heck. There was a year between initial shooting and the reshoots. And another year before Disney released it.  I guess the lesson is all the talent in the world means nothing without the right script."

I guess you have to write 300 words before this can be posted so here's my review of the franchise as a whole... like anybody cares.  I overall enjoyed all the films that came out in this franchise, but will admit they had their share of problems. For me, it was mostly the fifth movie I didn't care for. And also Ian McShane was underutilized. Even though I liked Blackbeard, I guess the standout character in the series for me was Geoffrey Rush's Captain Barbosa. Everytime he was on screen it looked like he was having the time of his life. And the CGI, come on, the movies are almost 20 years old and they still hold up. I know that's not too uncommon with blockbuster films in this caliber but I think it's still amazing."

When, over the course of the trial something comes to light that makes you realize your client may be criminally insane and not liable for his actions, this making it necessary to change the defense to insanity. But then, this not being possible because you should have done so before the trial even started.  I really don't understand how this could be the law.

Scarlett Johansson and Mark Ruffalo are probably the only two of the main guys with a viable acting career outside of the MCU and that's because both of them were already pretty mainstream when they joined.  Daisey Ridley headlined the biggest IP in the world and you couldn't find her as soon as that was over. Adam Driver is thriving but he already had a great catalogue of films before Star Wars. Oscar Isaac is a weird one because he had done a few great films and shows in a row before Star Wars but he has just leveraged that fame to go into other IPs, franchises and ensembles."

Most of them aren't funny but still!

I've been using streaming, which I assume is the same as a DVD or BluRay in terms of being a digital copy. So are they editing these out?  Follow up question: does anyone still use the cigarette burn to synchronize reels of film anymore? I know when I was a teen in ~2001 we would unwind all the reels onto this one, huge wheel before the digital era. So that seemed to make it unnecessary even back then since you didn't have to worry about changing reels. Just curious if this has completely disappeared from use."

You add the movies and the TV shows you want and it will generate a list with all their tracks. It doesn't have to be IMDB specific or provide links to the songs (even though it would help a lot). I know that you can find websites that do that sort of thing for individual movies or episodes however we are talking about thousands of movies and hundreds of TV shows, some of which have over one hundred episodes.

I actually think the 50s was a great decade for film. Obviously, I'm no stranger to “old movies” and I definitely don't get put off by black and white…in fact, I kind of prefer it in some ways.

I know Hitchcock started in 1922, but that's just way too old. I put on The Pleasure Garden for like 2 minutes and couldn't do it, even for appreciation's sake. I can't watch a silent film.  So I'm wondering, how far back should I start with Hitchcock's films? From what I can see, it looks like The 39 Steps is his first popular film, but if you guys think I should go back further than that, let me know. He has over 50 movies anyway, so I'd like to cut out the fat. Once I hit the 40s, I should be good to go, but where do you guys think I should start?  And I guess I'll just ask…is it worth pushing through his silent films? If it's worth it from a film perspective I'll do it, but idk man. I love film, but I can't do the silent stuff. I was thinking about starting from Blackmail, his first film with sound, but I noticed that there's still a lot of stuff between that and The 39 Steps, and these are all films I've never even heard of. It's not like Kubrick where he has only a couple of unknown films before he started making classics. Hitchcock has like 20 lol."

        "body": "Went out and saw The Menu and have a lot of complicated feelings about it. My most complicated feeling though, revolves around Tyler and the way he's both treated in the film and by the audience. I want to be really, *really* clear that this is not some incel-simp post, hand waving his actions away. What it is, is a shift in the perspective of events and a discussion on whether we think this was clever filmmaking or unintentional narrative.  While asking the internet not to be mean is a little like putting a Don't let your dog poop in my yard sign up: *These takes are after an initial watch so, there may be bits I missed or don't remember. I already plan to watch it again once it releases on streaming so, I will be giving this another shake.*  &#x200B;  **1.** **He knew everyone was going to die and brought her anyway.**  I have an incredibly hard time with this plot point for a few reasons and want to get it out of the way quickly, because it's not a factor in this discussion.   First and foremost:    *Who would take an email seriously from an internationally famous chef that says Come pay me an exorbitant amount of money to eat on my island. PS: I'm going to kill everyone there.?*   It just makes no sense. I get the idea, he literally tells people what he's going to do and it seems so outlandish they don't believe him. It's like telling your boss you're going to drive your car through a wall next time he walks by your desk and then getting upset at him when he gets upset at you for doing exactly that. I literally told you I'd do this, you cite as he calls the police. It's such an irrational claim that nobody would take it seriously.  Secondly:  *We have no evidence that everyone else there either did or didn't get the same message.*  The movie demonizes Tyler for bringing Margo because he knew she would die, and his excuse is  that the chef doesn't do tables for one. So, theoretically, he knew he was killing this innocent person, but didn't care because he wanted this experience. Even if you throw away my above issue that this knowledge is simply so outrageous that no one would take it seriously, we still don't have enough evidence to damn Tyler specifically here. How do we know everyone else in the room didn't do the same thing? Did tell me I'm a good dad man get this email invitation and bring his wife along anyway? Did she do that to him maybe? Did they both get it and both choose to ignore it? Did snobby food critic woman see it and laugh then invite her simp editor or whoever he was?   We simply don't have enough evidence that nobody else knew this information. If Tyler was the only one who knew, *maybe* we can dislike him for that. Even then, see point one. However, we don't know that everyone didn't have the same info or that they didn't do the same thing... So why do we focus on Tyler?  &#x200B;  **2. Tyler is both paying for Margot to be there, and paying her to be there.**  Margo \\[Erin\\] is an escort. People pay her for her time so that they can force their experiences on her. Now, I'm not here to talk about the morality of the trade in general or even the trade at all really; only the expectations that I think are fair given the situation.   Consider this: You plan a trip for you and a friend to Disneyland -- you make the arrangements, you drive, and you even pay for their room, admission, and \\[not to be too on the nose\\] food. Not only that, but you are a diehard Disney fan and this is the first time you've ever been. It's kind of a big deal for you. They... don't share your excitement quite so much, but they're happy to support you since you *are* paying, after all. Now, once you get there \\[remember, all expenses paid trip\\] they decide that they don't want to go to the park. They want to stay in the room and play their Switch that they brought with them. Not only that, but they talk shit on Disney the whole time and are generally kind of a downer.  Now, this is a *friend* we're talking about here. Someone you know and probably deeply care about. You'd almost certainly have a talk with them or get very irritated at their behavior. Imagine that situation with someone you don't even know, who's self-proclaimed job is for you to pay them and then they go along with whatever experience you're after, as long as it's within the boundaries they've set.   We know that he's paid her ticket price, because the movie literally tells us. We can assume that he's *also* paying her time price, because that is how she makes money. Her time is valuable, and she charges directly for it. Considering these three things \\[ticket, time, respecting service boundaries\\]; I think it's very strange that we're supposed to dislike Tyler for being upset that she's not only not participating, but *actively* not participating by having a snobby-to-openly-shitty attitude about it the *entire* time.  Yes, what he says is rude. Yes, he could let her be unhappy and not let that effect his experience. Yes... that's also kind of an idealistic outlook on human behavior... Especially when one is meeting their god-idol for the first time.  Again, I'm not excusing him of responsibility or saying it's cool to lash out at people. I just want to examine whether or not we're giving him a fair shake as a character, given the exact situation.  &#x200B;  **3. Why does the chef embarrass him in front of everyone?**  This was a scene that was a little strange to me as I was watching it, and has gotten more strange the longer I think about it. \\[Again, I could just be forgetting but...\\] Tyler never claimed to be a chef. He never claimed to have any kind of cooking skills at all. Sure, he makes some pompous-know-it-all statements, but I don't remember him claiming he could do better. Tyler is, essentially, just a Brony for chef Slowik and the art of cooking at large. I don't remember him *criticizing* the food even one time. Instead, he does everything he can to enjoy as much of it as he can, even going so far as to ignore the potential consequences of the life or death hide-and-seek game and insist on stuffing his face with what the others got. Tyler almost certainly has a Slowik body pillow at home that he holds at night. Great! So, what does he get for this adoration, this idol worship? Shamed. Shamed literally to death.   And for what? Being pompous? Isn't it possible... Isn't it a *little more than possible* that he was so nervous, so anxious, to meet his idol that he was not being intentionally cruddy? Haven't we all had moments of peacocking that make us literally cringe when we look back on them? Is that a death sentence?   This scene is a fairly large moment in the film for me, because it's one that either makes this a very clever satire or breaks it as something very basic and boring. Based on my interpretation of this scene, we either have an incredibly shallowly written character that is simply designed for us to dislike, or we have a tremendously brilliant piece of self-reflection that isn't designed to hit you until after the film is over.  &#x200B;  **4. I hope my interpretation of Tyler stands up to a second watch.**  It's easy to pan Tyler off as the shitty boyfriend character that we get to see our heroine break free from like in the theatrical \\[but not so much the director's\\] cut of 2019's Midsommar. But, what if he's not? What if, akin to 2017's Super Dark Times, there's a little more going on with this character than we're initially presented with?  Let's shift gears for a minute and talk about The Hunchback of Notre Dame and my favorite discussion around the Quasi doesn't get the girl issue. I can't find the source of it at the moment, but it basically boils down to Quasi and Frollo both see Esmerelda as something to idolize. Quasi to worship and please, Frollo to possess and use but, sides of the same coin. Neither see her for what she is: A human being. Phoebus, on the other hand, does see that in her. Sure he wants to absolutely slam, but he doesn't worship her and he doesn't want to *own* her. She, like him, is more complicated than people think, and he truly appreciates her humanity. She gets this, and so chooses the person who will facilitate her growth rather than nice-guy-Quasi or rape-guy-Frollo.  I *want* to interpret Tyler in a similar fashion. \\[I say want because I'm not sure this was the intent of the film.\\]  Starting even at the very beginning of the movie, Tyler is hero-worshipping Slowik. He scoffs at the corporate-bros as they walk and chatter down the steps, and he fawns over every single detail along the tour. One of the first things they're told is not to take pictures of anything, because the purpose of art is to be ephemeral. You are supposed to remember your experience with it, and thus, through that memory, you create the legacy of the piece. In a sense, *you* become the truth of the art you perceive. Tyler... Literally cannot help himself and immediately takes pictures of his food. Despite being told *by the artist* what the intent of the gallery is, Tyler is so obsessed that he *needs* to hang on to this memory for all time. \\[This, by the way, also justifies my point that he, nor anybody else, took the you're going to die threat seriously. Why would you take pictures of something if you're just going to die later?\\]  Tyler's photography is apparently *so egregious* that when others are given tortillas showing infidelity and financial fraud, Tyler receives images of... *SOON-TO-BE INSTAGRAM POSTS 😱😱😱.* In the micro, this is very silly. If we zoom out a little and consider the Hunchback analogy again though, I think there is something that can be said about it.  Tyler is sat behind the food critic. Her job is to critique restaurants and hold them to an impossible standard of perfection. Her words \\[as exemplified by the ever growing bowls of split emulsion\\] grow as they wind their way through her audience. A once split emulsion will become purported fingers in chili and hairs on plates by the end of the week as more and more play the game of criticism telephone. While, ostensibly, both her and Tyler share the same love of the craft, they personify this in very different ways. He, like Quasi, worships Slowik and others like him. They can do no wrong, they are perfect and should be adored, not criticized. She, like Frollo \\[well... sort of like Frollo. She doesn't want to cleanse Slowik's soul ;))))... or does she?\\], seeks that same perfection but she holds the world to an impossible standard and looks down on everyone because of it. Both are equally damming of the art because, both miss the point while insisting they see it better than anyone else.   In *worshipping* cooking and the people behind it, you're not seeing their creations for what they are. You're not internalizing what the pieces mean for you and you're not truly experiencing them because you already know it's either going to be perfect or you're looking for the right nick in the armor to poke at. Treating something like a god does not allow room for growth, and so deprives the artist of meaningful critique, interpretation, or legacy. In condemning art because of exactly that worship, you do the same thing. By seeing this Elysium of concept and holding all to that standard, you create a pretense that nothing will be good enough. And, thus, you also don't appreciate the art because you are only looking for the flaws.   So, what does this have to do with Tyler being embarrassed in front of the entire cast?   Everything.  Abstract Tyler from the context of this film for a moment. What is he? He's someone who is incredibly passionate about a subject he has very little or no experience performing. He's someone meeting their most precious hero for the first \\[and at $1,250, probably only\\] time. He's someone who wants to be seen. His presentation of his enthusiasm is a little immature, sure. But, that enthusiasm and passion is certainly not worth ridiculing on its own.  So... In this abstract form, who is Tyler?   Tyler is the person who watches hundreds of hours of YouTube on woodworking techniques and how to identify species of lumber, but doesn't even own a drill. He's the person who's very favorite thing is movies and he critiques and praises them almost without end, much the chagrin of his peers, but he couldn't work a camera to save his life. He's the cosplayer who's own costumes are nothing but plans and dreams, but could tell you the name of every stich, material, and technique used by the pros. Why are these people like this? Know-it-alls from around the web, nerds of various shapes and castes, the person who always has something to say about your favorite thing. Why do these people with such heavy handed opinions not just shut up and *become* the people they admire? Maybe it's because of financial reasons, maybe health barriers keep them from pursuing their craft, maybe they have more experience than this but they still aren't the pros they seem like to their less impassioned friends. Maybe... It's ok to just like something and enjoy speaking on it without trying to be the next David Blane.  In a word, Tyler is -- they are -- an amateur. And there is nothing the world likes to hate, quite like an amateur.  The whole film is about society's degradation of the value of art. Be it food, paintings, music, writing; any of it. Society doesn't care about it if they can't use it, consume it, or sell it. I have a lot of art in my house and one of the first questions I get asked when someone new comes over is, How much did that cost?. Rarely is the initial reaction a reflection of how the piece makes them feel or a question of who the artist is or the medium used. It's almost always directly related to the cost. Think about any time you have a meal with friends, family, partners. People ask what you got, then they ask what the bill was like. So, being that this is the purpose of the entire film -- the visual satirization of this dilemma -- I like to interpret Tyler's whole role as that of the amateur.  The person who loves a subject but cannot perform it in such a manner as to wow an audience or support themselves. Someone who's reach of knowledge exceeds their grasp of practice. Some are more elegant than others when displaying this passion -- with Tyler being on the more inelegant side of the spectrum -- but, what we see in the scene when he is shamed, is the very real personification of both Imposter Syndrome and general anxiety around putting yourself out there in the world.  Imagine that you love to write. Pressured by the constant nag of society to monetize your skills, you put yourself out there... and get destroyed. People hate it. They call it juvenile, pointless, stupid, boring, jejune, and derivative. You post it on multiple forums and the only feedback you get back, is that you can't do this. For all the studying you've done, all the books you've read, and all the passion you have; all the world can do is laugh at you. Over and over and over you're told that you can! You can be anything you want, *do* anything you want. But, when you take that first step out of their box, they laugh you right back into it. You're not ready, you're not good enough. And because you're not good enough now -- because that book does work in its current form, your game doesn't play smoothly as you have it right now, that chair you made doesn't sit flat with your skills as they are -- you'll *never* be good enough.   You, are an amateur.   I like to interpret Tyler's role in the film as that of an allegory to being an amateur in the real world. It exemplifies the way that mediocre work is demonized by society at large, made worthless through lack of attention, and deemed completely unprofitable and hopeless by those who are already succeeding. Decent, isn't good enough. Good, is forgettable... Perfect, is the standard. And if you can't produce to that degree *right now*, you might as well just hang yourself with your tie in the chef's office, because that's as close as you'll ever get to sitting in his chair.  Is this the intent behind Tyler's character? I don't know, I don't really think so. But I like to hope so. I like to hope so because it ends up being an excellent piece of self reflective storytelling where we, as the audience, totally side with Margo in the moment. But, if we stop and really consider who Tyler was -- an excited, anxious, passionate little boy at heart -- we kind of realize how shitty we are in jeering at his failure. He's not completely redeemable, of course, and I've already said multiple times that he *is* still wholly responsible for his actions. I just think that, in the context of everything else, maybe the film has led us to view him in a light we should consider a little more deeply in a real-world perspective."

Certainly under-seen considering their own contributions.    This distinguished them from most of their contemporaries-there's a hilarious Onion fake op Ed where 'Meryl' breaks this down comparing herself to other actors like Diane Keaton or Al Pacino and concludes that people should think of her as like, 'great actor, mediocre movies'.    This was true of DDL too until There Will be Blood in my opinion. None of his other movies come even close to it (even Phantom Thread which of course IS the second best of his but still..quite a far cry from TWBB as far as ultimate history of the art form goes I'd say).

No, I'm serious. That's sorta it. The title basically translates to the woman's name and her address which is fitting because that's what the movie is all about. It's very light on dialogue with the film mostly comprised of long shots of a single mom tidying up and prepping meals for her teenage son. She does venture out to grab groceries and check the mail ever so often. But the bulk is just her peeling potatoes, making coffee, making the bed and stuff   It sounds awful. But it's easily one of the best movies I've seen. I'll admit it does drag at times. But that's sort of by design. You really connect with her character. It's sorta hypnotic in a way. It's not going to be everyone's cup. But I definitely recommend it. It changed how I look at movies. A movie can be long, slow, and for the most part completely uneventful and still be totally riveting. Check it out."

I have also experienced this with Pretty Woman 10th anniversary edition. The borders weren't as big as Indian Summer but it still made the picture a lot smaller than a normal widescreen. What aspect ratio on the back of the DVD case would indicate that the movie will be shown with black borders on all sides?"

I was always attracted to something that was different from commercial movies...so when i started watching critically acclaimed and arthouse movies when i was 16... it was exciting enough to watch something I've never seen before and get disgusted,confused,blown away by it...but now it just doesn't feel the same... Honestly the kind of films that do resonate me or that i do like are movies like scent of a woman,Dead poets society,Good will hunting and movies like pulp fiction,kill Bill mainly because i guess these movies have a pretty simple story and maybe heavily stylised and might have some Easter eggs here and there but nothing major groundbreaking mainly these movies connect with me... I'm not trying to force or anything but i really wanna get into arthouse movies and want to understand films like a clockwork Orange,Mulholland drive etc(I've seen both of them ) without some reviewers or anything...  How do you actually watch an arthouse movie?"

I guess what I mean is: We're living a different time due to the internet, we can access anything from any time, which makes it easier for old things to be fresh in our memories and even so in the public's knowledge, since once you turn Gene Wilder's Willy Wonka into a meme, young people from nowadays will know the Chocolate Factory, sort of.  So what I'm saying is... movies don't have to stand out so they can be known for the years to come anymore, they don't have to be the most famous so they can be everlasting, because everything is.  I try to think of the movies from the 21st Century that could become classic 20 years from now, and... all of them are... forgetful? I don't know, definitely NOT because they're bad, but because they're celebrated for a while and then they join the piles of content on the internet. They're still being debated here and there, but by small niches.  There's only a few movies I can believe will be eternalized even outside the whole thing. The first one of them is actually a franchise, the MCU thing... although NOT the most perfect filmmaking product, feels like something that'll survive the test of time. It's popular enough now for me to feel safe to say it'll last for a long time.  Also... John Wick. Again, it's not perfect, but it has its own identity, it's getting more and more popular even outside the internet. It might not be the best action movie from the last 20 years, but I feel like it's gonna be the BIGGEST years from now.  What do you guys thinks about that? Is it a crazy thought? What are the movie that WILL become classic, in your opinion?"

True, Silence of the Lambs accomplishes both of these feelings but so do many other movies I never see considered horror.  Se7en is a prime example. I've never seen that mentioned as a horror film even though I think the horror elements are much more utilized in that than in Silence of the Lambs. What do you all think?

But four years before came a more tightly focused movie, a greek tragedy featuring people bringing on their own demise. It's basically a chamber play in the vein of David Mamet-- it's spare and selfish with its context clues. The performances straddle line between hammy and brilliant. Jeremy Iron's monologue is on the same level as Alec Baldwin's at the start of Glengarry Glen Ross. It recalls Gordon Gekko's praise of greed and I can't describe the delivery as anything other than juicy. Literally, Irons is savoring every word when he says, So that we may survive.  They talk about the market, but you don't really need to know the specifics of what it is they're trading to understand the disaster, like you do with The Big Short. It could be mortgage derivatives, it could be orange futures, doesn't matter, so if you're only kind of interested in the crypto element, but want more about the drama around the collapse, this pick is for you.

But as I was going through his filmography, I noticed something strange about a stretch of his films between 1990 and 1994: Almost all these movies involved an and actor of Italian decent getting violently destroyed by a small child and/or dog!     - **Movie:** *Home Alone 1 & 2*; **Victim:** Joe Pesci, Italian decent; **Crimes:** Violent use of household items, by a minor, to cause third degree burns, head trauma, and dental damage on two separate occasions.     - **Movie:** *Beethoven*; **Victim:** Stanley Tucci, Italian decent; **Crimes:** Viciously attacked by an array of K9s. Causing him to scream like a girl.   - **Movie:** *Beethoven's 2nd*; **Victim(s):** Chris Penn, Debi Mazar, Italian Decent; **Crimes:** Use of mother nature to ruin their clothes and causes Penn's head to land in a stump with more precious than Tiger Woods.    - **Movie:** *Baby's Day Out*; **Victim(s):** Joe Mantegna AND Joe Pantoliano, Italian decent (he was feeling rather violent this screenplay); **Crimes:** Infant Neglect that results in dangerous construction accidents and...um...something with a gorilla sexually assaulting them? (I don't remember and neither do you, so go with it.)    All these movies...all these innocent actors whose characters were put through the most painful tortures you could physically put a human being through. We're their characters bad? Yes, but were any of their crimes deserving of skull fractures, brain trauma, and possible rabies/gorilla STDs? Well...let me answer you by saying this: Martin Scorsese is one of the most brutal filmmaker's who puts his characters through hell (mostly of Italian decent) and even he wouldn't imagine the cruelty of smashing a paint can across a crime bosses face at high velocity.     What did they do to John Hughes? How did the Italian community hurt him in the late 80's to delve into such a harsh punishment of those that come from a culture of fine cuisines, beautiful music and art, and Parmesan cheese? Does any of this matter? Am I wasting my time trying to connect the dots to his anger towards the Godfather series? Should I be concerned that, while typing this pointless conspiracy, I've had David Harbour staring at me angrily while dressed as Santa Clause in a page banner ad? Fuck you."

        "body": "Warning: Everything in this review is coming from an appreciator of David Bowie, but not a die-hard fan.  This film is a puzzle piece of psychedelic visuals, Bowie's inner emotion, and the fact he was an influential adventurer that always valued natural change in the world.  I love the fact that the director, Brett Morgen, didn't have a narration guiding the audience into Bowie's journey. It was ALL BOWIE, no one else to tell his story except for his own voice. That's an element that makes this documentary different from every other one out there, and why it's one of the best-made documentaries I've ever seen.  My favorite aspect of this was the fact that Bowie detailed his family who had a long line of mental illness, and how he didn't have a very eventful childhood. These are the moments that made him who he was, simply because he wanted to change his appearance constantly out of the fear of never experiencing or exploring new identities or feelings of life. It sounds super hippyish, but seriously, it's super fascinating and insightful.  I love the intercutting of classic '50s and '70s cinema with cyberpunk and old-school sci-fi imagery while painting a picture of Bowie's years of work. It showcases his style perfectly while not feeding the audience a typical narrative. Much of the imagery also is of art and films Bowie made himself, which made me learn a lot. The editing and sound design is perfect here, and it's the true defining element of this trippy experience. The use of color grading is also incredible.  My only tiny gripes with this is that the pacing in the first twenty minutes is fast and energetic, but it surprisingly slows down to showcase Bowie's newer state of mind. The slower section is easily where the documentary really shines, making the faster stuff not as memorable. Also, the ending is a bit too abrupt for me.  Overall, it's definitely worth taking a look if you want to know more insight on a legend that's enigmatic, and there's a lot to love, including hearing Bowie's music."

        "body": "As a huge fan of the first film, which I thought was an underrated and super well-done thriller with fun and well-developed characters, I was looking forward to finally seeing this and was crossing my fingers in hoping this would be decent at least…  …and 'decent' it was.  Adam Robitel clearly wants to make a bigger world and narrative for this Escape Room franchise, and with the concept of having the new set of supporting characters be previous winners is awesome. However, he also tries to create a subplot regarding the game master and everything with that was super whatever, in my opinion. Also, the version I watched was the supposed 'extended cut' which added that subplot into it, so I watched the missing scenes from the theatrical cut, and I feel the extended cut made a little bit more sense thematically rather than the theatrical cut feeling like its overusing reveals and shock value.  Taylor Russell is solid here as Zoey, but Logan Miller does an incredible job once again as the character, Ben, who honestly might be one of my favorite horror/thriller characters of all time. He's super charming and funny while also having very realistic reactions and decision-making throughout the film. The rest of the supporting characters are acted very well but my personal standouts are Thomas Cocquerel as Nathan and Indya Moore as Brianna, both of them gave the best performances in my opinion. Isabelle Fuhrman was decent, but her material was not really that interesting to me.  The production and puzzle design for the new rooms are super wacky and creative, they definitely are an upgrade from the first film, personally. My favorites were probably the beach room and the city street room, they were extremely beautiful-looking and the different steps were super awesome. The tone of the film is a bit different from the glommy and grim tone of the first film as it becomes an '80s colorful cyberpunk-ish thriller, in a way that I really dug. The score is also very cyberpunk-y which I also loved, but that dubstep song at the end is laughably bad, and I love EDM. The humor was actually quite good, and the character development is solid, in which I actually felt really bad when characters died off.  My main issues though is that the 'game master' subplot is very bland and occupies the first and final act of this film. The second act is actually pretty incredible, but it being bookended by a cheesy twist in the end left a sour taste, in my opinion. Some of the green screen in the first act looked atrocious, and I didn't care much for the intro to this film. There are certain lines in the writing that were trying to be dramatic that were absolutely cringeworthy. There's literally a line that someone says that goes;  “What's this supposed to be?! A Tournament Of Champions?” Like, did they just Suicide Squad this film, come on?!  But overall, this turned out alright, and if Robitel wants to make a third one, I'll be there in no time."

For example, while we don't exactly know the cause of the gravity phenomenon. We do know that its responsible for Levi's death. What I don't understand is the end credit scene showing an orchestra humming the words to a song while holding a russian nest doll. This happens after the final scene showing the wind chimes. What is the significance of this? Is it just an extra scene that was cut from the movie or is somehow connected to the gravity phenomenon."

In reality it would've been more likely for them to be helped than harassed. Obviously racism still exists but not so widespread or blatantly to the point a black family couldn't go on a road trip without encountering a single decent white person. That's just not reality.   And the woke BS dialogue has me just about rolling my eyes out of my head.  Queen Latifah: “We're not criminals!” (Well…your brother literally is considering he just stole a bag of drug money from a murder scene).  Ludicris: “We're the next best thing…we're black.” Oh, how very 2022. Yawn.   I am extremely disappointed. This is not the first movie I've watched like this. Do directors not realize how awful and divisive it is to make movies with a black main cast that white people can't watch without being made to feel like dog shit? It legitimately feels like I selected something I shouldn't have because this movie is not for me, it's for the oppressed black population."

        "body": "hello everyone, this is my first review!  i recently watched the 2013 movie Bad Words, directed by and starring Jason Bateman. i tend to like bateman's acting, and i like his voice a lot. plus allison janney was in it, and she did a great job.  the movie plot was interesting at first, i'll admit: a forty-something year old adult man enters a spelling competition by abusing a loophole, and he won't say why he's doing what he's doing. alright, that's a pretty unique plot.  although i have qualms with the plot itself, i want to bring up what bothered—and continues to bother—me about this movie.  bateman's character, guy trillby, is the typical sarcastic, smartass jerk who treats anybody and everybody poorly—including kids, of course. early on in the movie, guy meets a young indian boy named chaitanya chopra, and it's established early on that this boy is very smart yet gets bullied in school (of course), and has a sucky dad.  guy is, obviously, uninterested and annoyed with chaitanya's attempts at conversation. at least, he is until he arrives at the hotel and is assigned to sleep in the utility closet. chaitanya tells guy that he has a whole hotel room to himself, and guy discovers that the room includes a mini bar. this prompts guy to start hanging out with chaitanya.  now, a complete stranger of a 40-something year old man hanging out with a 10 year old boy is creepy enough. but the stuff that guy teaches chaitanya about is disturbing, and only adds to the uncomfortableness.  foul language (not that severe, compared to the rest), frequent sexual topics, ways to disobey his dad . . . it just reminded me of my groomer.  and then, here's the worst part: guy decides to take chaitanya to see a **SEX WORKER**, and pays her to jump with her breasts out in front of chaitanya, who is TEN YEARS OLD. after the sex worker walks off, chaitanya then asks how much it would cost to touch the sex worker's breasts.  am i the only person who sees the problem here? a grown man, a complete *stranger*, takes a *ten year old* boy to see and touch a sex worker's breasts.  remember what i said about this being the worst part? well, here's the actual worst part: you may be saying that this is all fiction, so there's no reason to get all tRiGgErRed, but you need to realize that the actor was born in 2004, and the movie was released in 2013, meaning that the actor was only 8-9 years old during the recording.  ***does seriously nobody else see a problem with exposing 8-9 year old children to this stuff?!?***  putting that aside, i'm gonna rush the end of the review a bit because i got my main point out of the way and my phone is low on battery.  **spoilers**  so, you may be wondering why a 40 year old man has forced himself through this spelling bee, even while on national television.   well, wonder no longer, because i'll tell you: it's because the founder of the spelling bee is his father, and he's mad at his father for running out on him as a kid and wants to publicly embarass him.  really. that's it. a grown ass man ruins hundreds of children's experience with a spelling bee because he's mad at his daddy.   sorry bateman, but this movie is fucking weird and shouldn't have been made."

Michael Jai White gives a real powerhouse performance and his physicality is immense. I can't imagine anyone else doing that better. Oh, let's be honest, the actual physical suit (rather than the very poor CGI) is one of the best comic to film translations of a character's outfit. John Leguizamo is a wonderful page-perfect Clown (even if some of the lines he's given are pretty poor), and the discomfort of his suit shouldn't be overlooked either. That he pulled it off is a testament to his commitment and talent, he should be more appreciated. And say what you will, but I really enjoyed Martin Sheen's scenery chewing turn as the corporate villain. Looks like he had fun. Also, the film has a rocking soundtrack and a great punk-goth aesthetic. That combined was certainly enough for me to overlook the flaws and inconsistent tone, and my kid loved it. It's certainly no worse than some of the shit DCU and MCU have pumped out. It didn't play safe, it was fairly faithful, and it remains an oddity. Perhaps the most frustrating thing about the film is how easily it could have been better. Anyway, that's my piece."

The only claim to fame for In The Heights was Lin Manuel Miranda. Considering he wrote the original play, including the songs. I never saw the original play. I like his songs, but I'm not obsessed with him."

I've been enjoying the Wednesday series fine, but it's admittedly made me yearn for a return of this type of charactered content in feature form.  This trend of limited series on cable and streaming services has  certainly had its positive attributes, but it's also permitted a lot of overindulgence and time-filling in the scripting and editing stages. Outside of the likes of A24, a tight 100-minute runtime where every beat is a precision strike feels oddly antiquated of late.  A couple of friends and I talked last night and we each ranked Burton's films. While there were plenty of differences, we did find that all of our top 7-8 titles were the same in some order. Would love to hear where others stand on this, as I'm admittedly unclear as to what the general public opinion is of Burton's more contemporary work. I certainly know my opinion, but that of others interests me.  Here's my ranking. Feel free to question and judge; I'll defend my choices in the comments:  1.) Ed Wood   2.) Edward Scissorhands   3.) Big Fish   4.) Batman Returns   5.) Batman   6.) Beetlejuice   7.) Pee-Wee's Big Adventure   8.) Sweeney Todd   9.) Sleepy Hollow   10.) Big Eyes   11.) Corpse Bride   12.) Mars Attacks!   13.)

Not compared to the crooked cops, media mavens, and wrathful wardens. The treatment of women here is also interesting. Laden with abuse, assault, fetishistic scopophilia, and torture porn- we still manage to find feminism if you know how to look for it right. Though the lens runs over these scenes objectively, the viewer must see themselves as the victimized woman and be disgusted and angered by what is happening to her- to feel monstrous about watching it happen and understand the plight of why such women want revenge. Set against the wide open spaces of the ever-psychedelic southwest, with big red cars and southern drawls, this tinges on the fever dream of the frontier west. A 5/5 for me."

Thus, a movie which meets the following requirements:  * The movie DOES NOT have at least two men in it * If it does have two men, they do NOT talk to each other * If they do talk to each other, it's ONLY about women  Thank you to everyone in advance :)  EDIT: Extra points for movies that are enjoyable \\^\\^"

(I'm majoring in film is why I'm looking for more important recommendations than just casual enjoyment.)  Despite the fact that I'm a film major, I'm still very much one of those people who won't turn on a movie because I feel like I don't have time, and then proceed to watch 6 hours of a TV show.   To clarify, I'm not cinematically illiterate and have seen a good amount of the go-to “classics” like The Godfather movies, Rocky, Pulp Fiction, etc. However, I don't consider myself to be a film buff and I feel like I need to expand the list of movies I've seen. I'm basically trying to train myself to become a film buff—to an extent. (I'm not trying to be the stereotypical pretentious film major bro that glorifies Quentin Tarantino.)

I also don't have a problem with comedy adventure, triller kinds but the Action is requirement!A few examples that I really really like was : American Ninja, Death Wish, Lethal Weapon (movies and series) , Rambo and more. I like that fact that the sequels are always better than the first one even the first one has always higher rating in imdb. I have seen many of them so if you can recommend me some (not very popular) movies It would be easier for me not to have saw them already and i also would be much obliged.Thanks in advanced.

        "body": "I'm rewatching the series and the second and third film are usually noted as the worst of the franchise, which is pretty fair but I think they're still worth watching if I'm going to watch everything. In the third movie they think there is a mole feeding Davien information and they keep trying to push that it's Brassel even though it's the kind of stuff that is so obvious that no actual intelligence agent would take it serious, like calls from his office being linked to Davien when if Brassel was the mole he wouldn't be making calls I could be traced back to his office. Ethan Hunt is captured and is told that he will die but Julia, his wife, will live if he answers all their questions. Then the real mole, Musgrave, comes into question Ethan himself. This makes no sense because Ethan has shown no hesitation towards Musgrave, and even called him to give him information to protect the very thing he stole in order to save his wife since they can't go to terrorist. Nothing Ethan has said or did would lead Musgrave to believe that Ethan even suspects Musgrave is the mole, then asks if the information he got from another agent confirms that the agent that they're setting up, Brassel, looks like the mole and not him. Would Musgrave should know because Ethan has been relying on Musgrave for certain things that he wouldn't if he suspected him as a traitor. After this stupidity, he continues as stupidity by agreeing to Ethan wanting proof of life of Julia before he continues the questions and instead of putting the phone on speaker, puts the phone right next to Ethan's head when Musgrave knows that Ethan is essentially the best operative they've ever had and Musgrave is someone that only works in the office not actually in the field. It might be my biggest flaw of the movie just because the only reason Ethan gets to win is because one person that should know better does multiple stupid things at once letting Ethan win. He ends up being so useless at the end that he walks in and Julia just shoots him without him even looking like he he had the capability of using his gun. If Musgrave would have at least left someone else in the room so that Ethan did try to escape some with some skill or gun could have stopped him, or if he did anything logically at the end, maybe the bad guys would have won. Every time I see that scene is the most annoying thing in the franchise."

        "body": "*In case the title didn't tell you already, this is my absolute favorite of this trilogy. I remember that this was the first one I saw in the theater, and I especially remember watching this one the most times. This one felt like, “okay, we got past the boring stuff, and now let's get on to the main event.” To me, this one felt the most interesting and intense out of all of them, and for good reason too. We finally get to see Smaug the dragon in all his glory! More on him later though.*  Plot: Bilbo and the company of dwarves continue their journey to the Lonely Mountain. Meanwhile, Gandalf goes on his own side quest….  Characters: Not only do you have the previous characters from the last movie, but you have some new characters as well. Once again, Bilbo Baggins, played again as Martin Freeman, is the best character/actor in the movie. In the last movie, he started a great character arc where he gained a lot of courage over the course of the journey. In this movie, that courage grows. !<In the scene with Smaug near the end, Bilbo shows great courage while talking to a dragon that would kill him at any given chance. All while he's trying to steal the Arkenstone because it's a family heirloom for Thorin.!< For the dwarves, they're mostly the same: Thorin acts like a jerk to Bilbo sometimes, and the other dwarves act nice to Bilbo. >!Speaking of the dwarves, one of them, Kili, played by Aidan Turner, has a weird, pointless romance with an elf named Tauriel, played by Evangeline Lilly. Not only is this perhaps the most unnecessary addition to the story in my opinion, but they have no chemistry. What did she see in him? Sure they talked some, but I don't see it.!< >!At one point in the movie, and in the book, Gandalf leaves the company to deal with an ancient evil. As to who the ancient evil is, it's kinda obvious that it's gonna be Sauron. The whole buildup was to the identity was basically shouting out “it's totally not Sauron.”!<  Tone: The second installment of The Hobbit trilogy.  Music: Like with *An Unexpected Journey*, this also delivers good music. The music is filled with wonder, but mostly suspense.   Smaug: We are finally at the meat of what I wanted to talk about since I've started reviewing this trilogy. This is, what I think to be,  the best part about this movie. Some people even claimed that this is the scariest part of the whole movie. It's Smaug the dragon. Now why do I like this guy so much? His first appearance in the movie while the suspenseful music is playing is very bone chilling, and gives a feeling of dread, making this a perfect and suspenseful scene. Benedict Cumberbatch delivers a scary, yet memorable performance for the character. It's kinda weird how in the first movie, Smaug had four limbs with blue scales, but they redesigned him with two bat-like forelimbs with red-golden scales. I heard in the blu ray version of the first movie's extended edition, they changed that design in the movie to fit this movie's redesign. I do think it's pretty cool whenever Smaug gets ready to breathe fire, his chest glows orange. Similar to how Godzilla's dorsal fins glow blue/red/orange when he gets ready to breathe fire. There is one thing that makes me question about Smaug: After he took over Erebor and fell asleep in the treasure, did he ever go outside to get some food and water? I'd be starving and thirsty if I waited that long.   *The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug* is an improvement over the first movie, and perhaps the favorite in this trilogy.   Rating: 7.5/10"

But, as soon as you get past the most famous scene in the movie (the one where he puts on the glasses for the first time) it falls apart for me because the main character SUCKS.  First, even before anything goes down, he tells a black man that “the middle of the road is the worst place to drive”. When all he was trying to do was keep his head down, get paid and send money back to his family in Detroit that he hadn't seen in months. The ONLY thing this guy asked from our main character was to leave him alone and not bring whatever bullshit he was stirring up his way. Then, he proceeded to not only do exactly the opposite of what he asked of him (which was VERY little), but BEATS THE SHIT OUT OF HIM? 5 fucking minutes of beating the shit out of this poor guy just to put glasses on him to totally derail his life and sanity. Not to mention the absolute steaming pile of white man privilege he dumps on him with complete confidence when he initially asks him to leave him out of it because he wants to keep his head down. And after all of this he gets his ass killed. He also acts like a total moron 50% of the time he's wearing the glasses, drawing the MOST attention to himself possible. He was also suuuuper rapey to that woman he kidnapped. Am I alone on this? Everyone loves this movie and no one mentions that this guy is an absolute unchanged colostomy bag of a person. And it isn't just that. It was such a weird tonal change (and to be honest, quality change) after the glasses scene. But, what I mainly wanted to know is does anyone else see this guy like I do or is it just me? Just one more thing to add: I love John Carpenter films. This one just was really disappointing for me and not just because the main guy is an idiot. Just wanted to see if anyone else was feeling this way about the protagonist."

In fact it was one of the brilliant campaign with out of the box modus being used. The movie on the other hand had its moments and was being creative with the usage of the jump scares, but the way it ended left a lot to be desired.   The starting point was that how it was an educated and intelligent women that was going through that ordeal, and she was not only a healthcare professional, but a mental healthcare expert. Of all the people to believe that crackpot theories, she is supposed to be the least susceptible when it comes to believing that crap. It also press forth the point that how mental health is like something of a curse that cannot be broken, and if one of the person in your family is suffering from the issue, then you are bound to be affected by it and you cannot do much about it.   Being a mental healthcare expert, her first reaction would have been to make sense of some of the things that are happening in her surroundings. Instead she starts to investigate the curse and how people in the past are affected by it. In some ways, it tends to do a disservice to the mental health issues. There is already stigmatization and with the movies like this, it is not really helping the cause.   On a side note, has anyone noticed that most of the movies in which protagonist is going insane and is affected by it, 90 % if the cases are showed to be women. Is there is casual sexism in it that how these curses only tend to affect women due to being a weaker sex that can be easily manipulated."

The plot is overall very well-written, even though it's not perfect and has a few smaller problems, but they don't really take away from the experience and are barely noticable. It's also a lot like a Tarantino film. The cinematography is beautiful and the soundtrack is spectacular. Deep Purple's Hush has been playing in my head ever since I watched the movie. And in the end, the film ends in a satisfying and very amusing way, leaving a few uncovered mysteries. One more thing: I'd recommend not watching the trailer before the movie, as it spoils a few things. This is definietly a must watch for everyone who likes slower, mysterious, tense but also occasionally funny thrillers with great twists and satisfying conclusions."

While I would eventually grow into loving foreign films and appreciating the finer details of filmmaking, I cut my teeth on the movies HBO probably thought were filler during the day (and were mostly safe for kids like me) but they ended up being the movies I still carry with me to this day.  The thing is, for every Neverending Story that people more or less remember, there are movies like Krull that completely melted my mind or movies like One More Saturday Night (that I finally found out today was available to stream) which seem like complete throwaways but were \\*really\\* fun films.  So, what I'm hoping someone out there can help with is offering some movies that are in this what I would call 80s Goldilocks Zone as movies that were fun (comedy, adventure, action) but weren't at all heady, popular, and most likely one of the last things still available to rent on VHS on any given Friday or Saturday night at the video store.  I know there are other gems out there that would be incredible to experience for the first time so if you have any suggestions I would love to give them a run.  BTW, if you're wanting more examples of what I would call these 80s Goldilocks Zone movies, here's a short list that I put together:  **The Manhattan Project** (a **100% perfect** example of this type of 80s movie; plus, it stars John Lithgow, Cynthia Nixon, and John Mahoney)  **Rad** (yeah, people eventually came around on this one but I swear I wore out the videotape that I dubbed this on back in the day and it IS a perfect movie)  **BMX Bandits** (what an intro to world cinema; starring Nicole Kidman in one of her best roles to date, the movie is all about...walkie-talkies?)  **Real Genius** (probably on the outer edges of what was not very popular as it had an $8M budget and eventually brought in $13M but I rented this movie so many times and am tickled it's now out on 4K)  **Kuffs/Heathers/Pump up the Volume** (Christian Slater was tops in these, even though Pump up the Volume was released in 1990, but, for my money, Kuffs is flat out great)  **The Heavenly Kid** (Rotten Tomatoes says it's only 30% but my nostalgia says otherwise)  **My Science Project** (Fisher Stevens seemed to be everywhere in the 80s, plus Dennis Hopper is in the movie and this came out in 1985 with Blue Velvet coming out in 1986; not saying there's a connection but there couldn't be more of a difference in performances.  **Last Starfighter** (My intro to Sci-Fi. SIGH.)  **Explorers** (River Phoenix, Ethan Hawke in a rock-solid kid-friendly movie)  **Brewster's Millions and The Toy** (I remember Brewster's for the shiny baseball uniforms and the awesome ending when he punches Stephen Collins in the face who, looking at that man's life now, seems about right)  **Dirt Bike Kid** (Peter Billingsly post-Christmas Story. It literally blew this 10 year-old's mind that an actor could appear in more than one movie)  **Summer Rental** (John Candy, Rip Torn, and Richard Crenna make an insanely fun trio; plus, no matter how old I get I still find myself saying, for no reason at all, Your wife's on my WHAM-O.)  **Time Bandits** (My first taste of Terry Gilliam. I think it melted my consciousness. I love him for this movie alone)  **Three O'clock High** (Casey Siemaszko, Richard Tyson, and Jeffrey Tambor in a pitch-perfect movie that is directed insanely well, has a great pace, and has a great story; it received its due with a Blu-ray release but I cherish this movie)  **Summer School** (Mark Harmon and Kirstie Alley at the height of their powers, this movie is a funny ode to youth and the problems that come with being young; back when I had to rent this as a kid I had a tape recorder and \\*recorded\\* the movie's best bits so I could listen to them back later)  **Hiding Out** (Jon Cryer may forever be Duckie to some but this is a great, breezy view)  **License to Drive** (Back when getting your license was the ONLY thing you obsessed about as a teen, this movie starring the two Coreys, and Heather Graham, still is a lot of fun)  **Loverboy/Can't Buy Me Love/Run** (Yeah, Run is from 1991 but this triptych represents Patrick Dempsey's BEST work and I only 1/2 wish I was kidding)  **Moving Violations** (Starring Bill Murray's OTHER brother. No, not Brian Doyle-Murray, the OTHER brother, John Murray. It also stars Jennifer Tilly who is just amazingly funny.)  **Going Ape** (Come for the Tony Danza and stay for the orangutans and a silly Danny DeVito; I don't know if these primates were treated well but they add a metric ton to the humor of this movie)  **How I Got Into College/One Crazy Summer/Better Off Dead** (Savage Steve Holland forever)"

This gives the viewer knowledge of what is to   come. Without this, I feel that the movie would have felt different. The movie would have changed to be about optimistic love story to a story with twist and turns that will ultimately end in heartbreak. This flash forward only goes to about half way through the characters knowing each other, which doesn't completely spoil the movie and keeps the viewer wondering what might happen after. I thought that after they broke up, they would get back together, but they never did. Tom keeps trying to get back with her, but he never does and ends up presumedly finding love.   The movie darting around from the start of their relationship to the end is a great way of showing that the relationship went wrong, but leaves the viewer curios of how it went wrong. Throughout the movie, I get on thinking that Summer and Tom were great for each other, but the flash forwards did not support this. During the flash backs, Summer says that she does not believe in love. This helps the viewer partially understand why they might break up. This is then reassured during their final meeting, all the way at the end of the movie.  What did you guys think of the movie?"

Them realizing they government experimented on them, trying to get a lawyer to take their case, being intimidated by the government, the chemist coming out and explaining what happened etc. It seems to be a good explanation for what was happening during the first half, and everything that happens in the second half fits in with the government conspiracy premise. The ambiguity seems to be gone. I think there's only one time the demons return during the second half, which is when he's in the hospital. But the fact that these are now being presented as his hallucinations take a lot of the punch out of that scene.  Then in the last 2-3 minutes, we find out the entire thing was a dying dream, but also suggest that the whole experimented on part of the dream was something that really happened.  Also the whole the devils are really angels speech was strange, because there didn't seem to be any ambiguity to the creatures in the first half. They were really malevolent creatures that seemed to want to torment him, not free him from the past. Likewise we're told that he needs to let go of the past to move on, but the ending is him choosing to go back to his past over his new life and moving on from their (choosing to keep trying to find out what happened in Vietnam when his friends had moved on, choosing to go back to his old house, finally leaving with his son).  Interesting film, but I was left with the feeling they didn't really know what they wanted it to be, and it probably would have been a lot stronger if it was three separate films."

It would be a great change -up for the Bond character, while giving a remarkable actor a chance to put her mark on an iconic franchise.   She's been overlooked.  ETA:  I guess I didn't think about tossing the franchise on its head, and I wouldn't want to look to make any political statements with the casting.  I understand James Bond is James Bond.  It would just be cool to see Jodie Comer in a role like this. A few months back people were tossing out every name out there, including some women.

I wanted to fill in the gaps in my knowledge of his stuff so I threw this on Amazon Prime earlier and enjoyed it quite a bit.  The story's really interesting, and this period of the last decade or so of the Cold War isn't one that I'm most familiar with so I learned a lot from this. Sorkin tells it in a really clear and gripping way and in hindsight I think there's some really interesting parallels to draw between this situation and what's happening in Ukraine.  But I think the performances might be the standout component here. Tom Hanks is unsurprisingly great. Hearing him speak Aaron Sorkin dialogue is a real pleasure that I'm glad exists as a film fan. And even though he doesn't play villain here like he does in Ladykillers, seeing him play even a somewhat flawed character is still really cool and unique to see. Despite the accent, I enjoyed him in Elvis for this very reason.  Phillip Seymour Hoffman is also excellent. He's probably the funniest character (at least for me, since his dry, sarcastic sense of humor matched well with mine), but I liked that he wasn't just the comic relief. His knowledge of the situation is vital to the narrative and the discussions between him and Hanks as to how to go about this were really cool. The more I see from this guy the more I miss him. Such a unique talent.  And even though they're smaller roles, I was glad to see that Amy Adams and Julia Roberts had something interesting to do. (Roberts especially. I think this might be her best work besides Erin Brokovich. Whenever she steps outside the romcom genre I find her performances are better for it.)  If I had a minor gripe I'd say that even though it's quite short I do think it could've been shortened a little more. Not a lot, it's just that the editing is a little slow in spots so there's certain cuts that could come a little faster and shave 5 minutes off the runtime, if that.  But I think this is a very worthy addition to Sorkin's filmography. Not his best movie by any means, but not his worst either. Well worth watching if you're a fan of his or interested in the subject matter."

While she was exiting the storage unit, she cut her hand. One of the first things Dr. Lecter said to Clarice during this meeting was, “Your bleeding has stopped.” Clarice looked briefly at her hand and said, “How did you - it's nothing, a scratch” and quickly changed the subject.  I always assumed that Lecter in fact WAS talking about the scratch on her hand, but after watching the movie again recently, I wonder if he was pointedly referring to her period. If it was her hand, I would think he would have made a more direct statement, like “Tell me about your hand, Clarice” or even commented that he was still able to hurt people while in his cell.  Clarice's reaction made me think that this possibility occurred to her as well (and that he was correct) and she changed the subject to keep him from going down that path, and out of shock from his being even more intuitive than she first realized.  It's a pretty minute point, but did anyone else think that's what he meant?"

For instance, here in Finland and Sweden in some form as well, there's a belief that a figure called Canute takes away Christmas every 13th of January. As you might expect, this figure is also based on a Saint like Santa; most likely St. Canute of Denmark whose feast day incidentally falls on 7th of January so you can definitely get some lucky/unlucky parallers there. As for the plot, him 'taking away Christmas' would naturally make Santa and the elves fearful of his presence but it's ultimately a necessary job to be repeated every year.

The cinematography, horror, and gruesome aesthetic of the scenery of the film make it one of the most beautiful films of the year. Also with the great acting of the two main actors. Maren and Lee are played by Taylor Russell and Timothee Chalamet, they both gave their best performances here, especially Taylor who plays the main character.   Most of the film is focused on her and her emotions toward her lifestyle of her being a cannibal, she battles with her feelings on the topic and how it's changed her and then sees a reflection of herself in Timothee's character Lee. I have seen Taylor Russell in other projects, but this is her best performance yet, I was hooked from the beginning. Timothee has always been amazing in every film he's in, he always gives it his all, and what a performance this was. I truly think this is his best performance as an actor.   Not only was the cinematography and suspense in every scene beautifully well done, but also the score of the film was sentimental, there were a lot of hidden meanings to certain scenes with metaphors, and with the amazing cinema, the score, and the directing you could see what Luca was going for. I never read the book so I don't know if this follows the source material well, but I can say that this was a great film, I didn't know how far the plot would go, but once it took off I didn't want it to stop, the ending is sad.   One thing that I loved that the film focused on the most was the romance between Lee and Maren. Bones and All is truly just a love story and a beautiful one that almost made me cry by the end I'll give it an 8.1/10. This film is very creepy, gruesome, gross, and very Rated R for a reason. Some people even walked out of the theater I was in because it was too much, but not for me."

The constant yelling, confusion, camera work, makes you tensed and anxious. I actually watched it over three sessions because I just could not sit through it in one go! Not complaining, appreciated the style.  The ending was rather surprising. I personally liked it because Howard was the source of all the chaos.   You feel quite invested in the story – there were so many moments where I felt the need to yell at Howard to use his brains more and not cause more chaos with the incessant talking!  Definitely a must watch! A good story and Sandler was exceptionally good. However, I don't think I can ever rewatch this. It's just too chaotic and stressful."

The acting was much better than I had expected. It also keeps you thinking, the psychological aspect was very good. The overall concept is creepy, and eerie.   The bad: The overall story is unexplained. I wanted to know more about this demon thing. But was left hanging. Overuse of jump scares. I don't mind one here and there, but when most of the scary parts are loud noises with someone (something) appearing and going away, it takes away from it.   The ugly: The entity, demon or whatever is just ugly looking. It was the least scary part of the movie to me. Before it opens its face it looks like Michael Jackson, after it looks like Grimmace. This seriously undid all of the set up to the movie.   Notes: The movie seems like it may set up for a sequel, however the weakness's of this movie didn't really make me interested in a potential sequel.  The movie feels like a mesh of The Happening and Final Destination with a demon entity added in. Overall an interesting combination that worked really well, until it didn't."

They're allways dropping references to it, named a tour after the movie, and even started a joke campaign to raise the Rotten Tomatoes score, which resulted in the score dropping, because in their words People are actually watching it and realizing it really isn't a very a good movie!  Sure enough it's got a 5/10 on IMDb and a 13% on Rotten Tomatoes, so between that and these various podcasts always admitting the movie actually does suck, I was a little turned off about watching it, but last night I finally gave it a go and wound up having a blast.  I mean, for starters Dan Aykroyd is just hilarious going full ham as the judge. I feel like if just about any other actor did that role it'd be unwatchable, but Dan Aykroyd's got some sort of charm to him that makes the character an absolute riot.   I also absolutely loved the visuals, there was something about the chaotic, spooky junkyard setting that was really aesthetically pleasing to me. It reminded of the I, Spy books I read as a kid, where each page was this intricately detailed setpiece and you'd have to find bits and pieces in each scene.  Then you just have how unhinged and weird the movie was. You have the dinner scene, you have John Candy both as a cop and as his own sister, which is just John Candy with a dress, makeup, a wig, and fake tits, you have the judge executing people with the Mad Max-esque rollercoaster, the Bonesplitter, you have the whole scene with the judge bringing in a bunch of rappers (including a pre-fame Tupac Shakur, oddly enough) and performing a rap number with them, with him jamming out an organ solo, which ultimately winds up being a pretty pointless scene, you have the grotesque diaper-wearing man-baby twins, Bobo and Lil Debbul, you have the judge's nose looking like a dick at a random points of the movie, there's just so many strange moments and details in Nothing But Trouble that make it the ultimate What the fuck am I watching?! flick.  I almost don't even know if I can really recommend it or not since it technically isn't that great of a movie, but it's so batshit insane that it somehow loops around to be extremely fun to watch. I think I'm mostly curious how many other broken people there are out there that enjoy it as much as I do."

But what about the Ye Olden Times?  Prey rewinds the clock back 300 years to the Native American Comanche times to let us meet Naru, a Comanche medic. Sorry, *healer* is the correct term here. Even though she's teached in the ways of medicine, she wants to be a hunter, aided by her good buy Sarii. Out hunting, she sees a spaceship, which she believes to be a Thunderbird, something Wikipedia tells me is a legendary mighty creature for Native Americans. Determined it will be her way of proving herself as a hunter, she sets out to kill whatever it is. If it bleeds, we can kill it. (Which I actually said right before the movie did.)  At a tight 100 minutes with credits, the movie holds a tight pace. Tight movies are *tight*. The movie builds itself up to the ultimate showdown of ultimate destiny. Introduce the fighters, show their abilities, have them cross paths, and boom boom boom, boom boom, badilla life.  Amber Midthunder (who actually *is* Native American along with the other actors in the Comanche cast) is as strong in the role of Naru as Naru is in the movie. The Predator's threat is increasingly shown in the beautifully shot action scenes. My lord, this movie looks beautiful. The sound and music is great, building up the tension.  Strong lead + beautiful camera work + great action + tight pace and runtime = A damn good and enjoyable hunt, ehrm, movie."

Paul Mescal was brilliant in it as was the young girl playing Sophie. Such natural scenes between the two of them that it never felt like they were acting at all.  The scene of Callum sobbing on the bed was just so jarring to watch. I felt like he was in such inner turmoil within himself but was doing his best to cover it up... always moving onto the next activity...the tai chi...books to try and cure him of his illness...him saying he didn't think he'd make it to 40...the lack of care in his wellbeing with his broken wrist and almost getting hit by the bus. He really captured how much of depression is suffering in silence but doing your best to just keep going in the hope it'll get better but slowly losing hope when each day you feel worse and worse.  Sophie was a brilliant character as well. Such a natural actress and I loved the idea that as children we see our parents are superheroes and are oblivious to how much they can be struggling but we still pick up on subtle signs that all is not well beneath the surface.

The connection between the plot and the Russian boy was just amazing. It wasn't even so much of a plot twist so much as it was just beautifully done.

I get really interested in the career paths of actors and what their resumes say  Powell has had many voice-acting gigs and tv roles. I guess his biggest TV role would be a 16-episode stint in Scream Queens.   However, even before then, Powell was working alongside some of the biggest names in action in Expendable 3.   Then, Powell was in Hidden Figures, alongside a whole new batch of acting powerhouses.   Then, Powell took a stab at co-starring in the Rom-Com Set It Up.   Then, just 4 years later, Powell was cast in goddamn Top Gun: Maverick, in a major role. Some would say that the pecking order, in terms of character importance, in that movie was Cruise, Teller, Powell.   Now, Powell is the literal co-star in Devotion, alongside someone who's experiencing his own career boom, Jonathan Majors.   Have we been seeing Powell creeping closer and closer to that movie star spotlight? The guy can act, and it seems like Hollywood is agreeing."

Besides “make it rain”, he also is hilarious in the theater production of Jesus Christ Superstar. His one scene with Alec Baldwin is also electric. Love the guy and the performance. Even though he was so good in serious roles. I wish a little more often he would've taken fun comedic roles like this. Obviously he was also great comedically in Boogie Nights."

I think the movies production and subsequent press stuff as really done the movie a major disservice, and that's a shame.  As always, Florence Pugh is incredible to watch.

They generally go between 6.5 and 7.5, which is accurate to me as I do not recall many standout productions in the last few years (due to COVID). You really have to be something else to get a score of 7.8 and above. That is not to say that movies have become worse in quality - I think that 7 out of 10 is a fairly okay score to have. In school it means that you did good. Not excellent, not amazing, but good. Even if I do not agree with the scores sometimes (most recently with the The Fabelmans), those movies who raise above the rest truly captivate people and are talked about whenever I go. I remember back in the day, when only fans would rate a production first, how inflated the score was. I had to wait several days or weeks for it to turn to a more realistic number. Maybe this is due to people becoming more critical of movies, which is excellent in my opinion, or there is a sort of a new algorithm they set, I dunno. Or movies have become more diverse. Or more people are watching them. I don't know. All I know is - as a person that can not have all of the time in the World I rely more on the score system than I did before and I am more often than not not disappointed as I go with fairly realistic expectations, knowing that the movie will be worth my time beforehand.     Edit: I am just going to post a comment I made in the thread to not repeat myself regarding why scores are important:  How can you tell if you are going to enjoy the movie? Let's all just gamble all of the time as it has been proven that even with excellent casting, director and screenwriters a movie can be a waste of your time (Amsterdam). It is so wonderful to decide for yourself when you have the time and the energy to do so. I am not going to spend 2 and half hours of my life just going blindly to something that can potentially piss me off. And reading reviews most of the time spoils the movie and the moods in it. Watching trailers does this too. You wanna know what does not spoil the movie, but tells you that you might enjoy it - score. How can you assign a score on a movie??? - did people like it and how much did they like it. This is how. Just by seeing the score I know many people enjoyed the movie and they felt it is a good movie. This is enough for me. I will invest my time. But people's opinions are subjective!. If many people with subjective opinions like a particular product, then you know that that product is good. Also, people have become more critical of mediocre movies, which cater to all audiences. It is not enough for them, they want more and so they rate the movie accordingly.  Also, there is nothing wrong with fan service, nostalgia and callbacks. Some people think that movies have to be this high form of art that should not target general audience. And this thread proves it. Movies are entertainment - they are there for you to forget the World around you and enjoy 2 or so hours of storytelling or thrills. It is that simple. If a movie can make a lot of people do that, I call it a good movie. And if those people give the movie a high score of their experience, I will go to see that movie. But, but movies are subjective, because all of the people are different!!! We are not that unique for this to be true. "

However, I can recommend it for being so scary, because I think it was meant to be.  I didn't like Nope at first. By at first, I mean within 3 days of having watched it.  I thought it was an overall very plain, ordinary kind of film. Nothing really stood out as fantastic. Then again, I'm traditionally more of a Christopher Nolan, Marvel kind of person. I like things that are a bit wackier and exciting. Less of a sophisticated film junkie.  Also, I'm not a fan of horror. It doesn't sit well with me, but I do like Jordan Peele's take on things, and thrillers (not just pure horror) are cool to me, which is why I've given his stuff a shot.  Anyways...  It's been months now since I've seen Nope, and it has had a profound effect on me.  Anytime someone mentions UFOs, seeing gray disks in the sky. Hell, even when I'm out driving and the sky looks a certain way, Nope (literally the word) comes straight into my brain.  And then along with the word, the feeling.  This kind of disturbing, sad feeling like when you read about a tragedy that makes you feel vulnerable and really impacts you. To be honest, I feel a bit scarred by the film. I would probably prefer to forget it. Get Out and Us didn't make me feel that way.  I only feel compelled to talk about this film because it wasn't as well received as Jordan Peele's others, but it's also not a film with the same kind of immediate impact. It's not until months have passed and you still have that disturbed, anxious feeling any time you remember the film that you realize Nope was actually a masterpiece."

I could really expand my repertoire.   I also like movies/shows where I can learn about other cultures accurately. Whereas, I know some movie makers make a point to get all the cultural aspects correct and in detail. For example, I just watched Unorthodox on Netflix and it was informal to learn about the culture of Orthodox Judaism, which I knew nothing about before. It was a little depressing for my taste but I really liked learning all about another culture in an entertaining way. I also watch TGBBS which is interesting to learn about British culture.  I finally like feel-good movies and shows. For example, I just watched He's Just Not That Into You, which I liked. I also watch New Girl sometimes which is a happy show, but I really have a hard time finding a good happy show to watch."

She had a good parent that loved and supported her when she was young. She goes through trauma (the loss of her most supportive parent) around the age where she starts to develop her own personality/outlook on life.   But, since she has lost her most supportive parent and her neutral/grief-stricken parent has perhaps selfishly remarried before she was ready, she has a set of parents that don't understand her when she fully expresses her thoughts/feelings and don't support her decisions.   She runs from a set of good parental figures at the first small conflict between them, and rebels by getting into a relationship with a creepy older guy who used his relationship with the good parental figures to get to her and is only interested in her for one reason. She gets in too deep with him, so the good parental figures redeem themselves in her eyes by stepping in and saving her when no one else could/would.   Bada-bing bada-boom, she ends up happier and healthier now that she has surrounded herself with those who love and accept her for who she is and encourage her to continue to grow and make mistakes and have fun and learn.   The creepy older guy goes to prison.   The end.   Bonus thought: “Beetlejuice” is a euphemism for menstruation/getting your first period/losing your virginity. Like how the cochineal is harvested to make blood red dye. This has to be a thing, right?"

It reminds me of all the things i try to bury deep into my unconscious, but this movie brings them up and makes me think about them. It becomes obvious to me that the Optimism i have for the future of our society is simply me tricking myself in order to have a happy live, i just avoid thinking deeply about our collective situation and future, something that was hard when i was younger but as i get older i just care less and less, i have become more individual, selfish, nearsighted... and it worked and i will keep doing it regardless of the reality.  I truly think this movie is a intemporal masterpiece and as time goes by it will get more recognition.  Movies like this really reminds me of my love for films, movies that make me deeply think and emotional for hours and hours after watching them. Arrival and Mother! Are other movies that made me feel that way  I'm sorry for my bad English and my badly explained convuluted ideas, i just needed to get it off my chest."

Tonally and in terms of characterization; in its set pieces.  And by the end, I was crying laughing. It's actually a really brilliant film, because of how perfectly, and in how many ways, it is just the worst film they could make. It's really perfect in this way.  Reading about it later, I saw it was a passion project of Bruce Willis'. And that really puts it in perspective: here's this guy who was one of the biggest stars in the world. And THIS was the film he truly wanted to make.  There is a reason for that. He spent his life immersed in film sets and understood how to transform all of that experience into a perfectly terrible film. The idea must have been hilarious to him, and I thought it was hilarious too."

With all that being said….one of the worst movies I've ever seen in my entire life. First of all the daughter is the worst character I've seen in a movie or tv show. She was screaming constantly man and it made me wonder why they even casted her in the movie. The son was ridiculous. Had a death wish just tryna help people. He is in a HUGE explosion radius but somehow miraculously is at the house waiting on the dad in the end of the movie. Tom Cruise with some crazy grenade plan that blows up the alien from inside. GET THE HELL OUT OF HERE. Not a single character in this movie I liked. Was routing for aliens.   Then as if all this wasn't bad enough these unstoppable aliens who have been planning this here for thousands of years? Millions of years? Are still somehow outsmarted by regular old nature because they didn't build up immunity and of course humans come out on top. If weapons couldn't get past the force field then how did birds? And even if they were weakened by no immunity they would not just die off over the course of a couple days.   I can not stand when movies always have this feel good ending man. Humans are always so smart and just can't be beat. I would love if the movie ended with the aliens just trampling over everything and everyone. Movie over.

We're talking about a kids movie that surprisingly appealed to adults to an extent (Facebook mums seem to be the only adults who can tolerate, let alone love the Minions), and since the Minions were the highlight for the kids who watched the movie, adults who took their kids to see it were pleasantly surprised with everything else (but still found the Minions annoying).   So after I fully ignored the Minions rewatching the first movie, I was reminded of the storyline, and of the film's main antagonist (voiced by Will Arnet), a corrupt bank manager who funded criminals to carry out large-scale crimes, including protagonist Gru. However, it is revealed that Vector, a criminal that is trying to pull off the same plan as Gru, is the bank manager's son and that the two of them planned to get rid of Gru to cut costs for their own personal gain, which they successfully did when the manager (think his name was Perkins) set Gru up by having Vector steal a shrink ray off Gru to make it look like Gru had failed.   However, we're now on I think the 6th film of this franchise, with a 7th and 8th on the way, and Gru never found this out, meaning Perkins got away with this, despite Vector being killed (it wasn't shown on screen because it needed to maintain a kid-friendly tone, but he's definitely dead given that he got launched into outer space and was left stranded there, where his oxygen levels would deplete in three minutes)  I haven't seen the second one in a long time, but didn't Gru then become a counter-terrorist in that one? Surely Perkins must have started funding other ambitious criminals after his son's death (which he may not even know about)? And surely Gru would realise this would be happening even though he never found out that Perkins actually set him up to fail his plans to steal that shrink ray? Six films, each grossing so much more than anybody would ever expect, and yet this hasn't been fixed or even addressed once? (I haven't seen all 6, only seen 1 and 2, but I went on IMDB and saw that Perkins wasn't in any of the sequels after 2, meaning he was never stopped by Gru or anybody.)   I'm fully aware that this is a kids movie and this issue will probably never be fixed because these sorts of movies aren't designed to be particularly plot-driven or focus on their serious aspects, but am I really the only one that noticed this? It seemed impossible not to notice when I rewatched this movie."

We're both college students, so our budget probably wouldn't cover much concessions if we bought it from the theater. I mean probably, but that stuff is way overpriced anyway.  When I was a kid I remember going to the theater all the time with my family. There was a dollar store right next to it so we always got packs of candy to bring in, and even though the rules stated that you couldn't bring outside food and drinks, from my understanding it was ok as long as it wasn't obvious. I later got to know people who worked there, and they didn't care.  I don't remember what the theater I used to go to was, but I know that the one I am going to go to is either an AMC or Galaxy, both have rules against bringing food and drinks in, and they both have rules saying they can refuse service to anyone, which makes me skeptical to the legality to all of this.

If you are someone who has enjoyed any of his other stuff (or even if it is totally new to you) I would give it a strong *strong* recommendation.  It mixes all the mainstream appeal of Your Name or Tenki no Ko with the lingering sense of melancholy found in his older stuff like 5cm per Second. And the quality of the animation is just peerless (seriously, it really deserves to be seen on a big screen).  My only worry is that the movie could potentially struggle to find the same substantial audience overseas as his last two movies did, as it is a more explicitly 'Japanese' experience than either of them. But it absolutely deserves to find a home with Western audiences, too. If anybody had any lingering doubts that Shinkai is the heir to Miyazaki's legacy, this should be the final word."

Room 237 has nine segments, each focusing on a different element within The Shining which may reveal hidden clues and hint at a bigger thematic oeuvre.[5] Produced by Tim Kirk, the documentary's title refers to a room in the haunted Overlook Hotel featured in The Shining."

        "body": "Yesterday at Thanksgiving, me and some family sat down to watch The Woman King. We were initially going to watch Wakanda Forever, but since we didn't have Disney+, this movie was the unfortunate second choice. Now I'd seen a lot of reviews for the film and it's historical inaccuracies. But I genuinely don't care. If it still works as a film, I'm good with it. And since there were no parts in most reviews on what actually made it a bad FILM, I was going in with an open mind.  And my mother wasted twenty dollars that she will never get back. The movie killed any tension it would have in the first five minutes.  The Agojie warriors attack some camping Oya soldiers. They had the element of surprise, but instead of displaying the intelligence and capability of the Agojie, they decide to just show how strong they are by giving that element of surprise up and just fighting the Oya (who outnumber them by like ten dudes) head on like the geniuses they are.  They best the Oya despite the number difference with ease with only one Agojie dying. This is a consistent theme with this movie by the way. So immediately the army of the main villain poses no threat. But this alone wasn't enough to completely end the movie. A lot of movie have strong characters beat a bunch of fodder. Who cares?  But that's until you get Oba, the main villain and the leader of the enemy tribe. He's the one who forced himself on Viola Davis' character. He is the main big bad boy. Now as the rest of the army is complete garbage, you'd EXPECT Oba to be some kind of challenge right? Boy was I wrong...  It was clear from the rest of the movie that Oba isn't very smart and not a great general given he keeps losing fights with more equipment and easily outnumbers the Agojie, so I'd expect that he'd be physically powerful. A skilled warrior with training that allows him to be a threat to the Agojie--what am I talking about? He isn't shit. He just BARELY manages to kill one Agojie soldier and gets injured in the process. Mind you, the Agojie who were injured in this fight were injured by gunfire, which they can't dodge (but if you're Viola Davis, you can literally deflect them with your sword), or slashed up by droves of Oya tribesmen.  If another Agojie attacked, he would be fucked because he's the equivalent of at most two average Agojie warriors. The elites would dominate him and this is shown by the absolute murder that is Viola Davis VS Oba. She was absolutely destroying him until he threw some dust in her eyes. He started beating her up for a few seconds before she turns the tables back and unceremoniously kills him like the total bitch he was.  What a travesty of filmmaking. There's nothing worse than an action movie with zero tension. And you may think this is simply a nitpick, but it isn't.  These two tribes were at war for YEARS (at least 19). If the Agojie are this strong and the Oya this weak, how haven't the Agojie beat the Oya however many years ago? It's a major plot point that's affected by this.  Such a disappointment   (Now take a look at the downvotes. My fault for thinking people on a subreddit about movies were ready for discussions about movies.)"

I feel like by glossing over, omitting, or just outright re-writing history it makes the subject more of a mythical figure vs truly exploring how complex of a human they were.   As a result many of biopics are more fiction with just sparkles of truth in them. Atleast that's how I see them."

        "body": "There have been a bunch of Whodunnit movies this year, many of them somewhat comedic in tone. This is possibly due to a lot of studios trying emulate the success of 2019's Knives Out.  I am all for it. I love the genre. It is easy to watch and encourages a well-written script. Below is a breakdown of all of the Whodunit movies I have seen from 2022. I would say all are worth watching.  Did I miss any?  # 1. Vengeance  **Writer/Director**: B.J. Novak - The Office, The Premise  **Cast**: B.J. Novak, Boyd Holbrook, Issa Rae, Ashton Kutcher, J. Smith Cameron  **Plot**: B.J. is a wanna-be podcaster looking into the death of a girl he hooked up with.  **Thoughts**: Slightly more dramatic in tone. The comedic moments tend to be dry, but often land. Tries to be a bit deeper at times and usually succeeds. Some may not love the end, but overall big fan.  **Runtime**: 1h 47m    **Streaming**: Peacock  # 2. Confess, Fletch  **Writer/Director**: Greg Mottola - Superbad, Adventureland  **Cast**: Jon Hamm, Lorenza Izzo, John Slattery, Kyle MacLachlan, Marcia Gay Harden  **Plot**: Ham is a former journalist who gets caught up in a scheme around stolen art.  **Thoughts**: Loose and light with some sillier moments. Becomes almost too convoluted, but wraps up nicely in the end. Wasn't a huge fan of Chevy Chase's Fletch, but liked Hamm in the role.  **Runtime**: 1h 38m   **Streaming**: Showtime  # 3. Bodies Bodies Bodies  **Writer/Director**: Halina Reijn/Sarah DeLappe - no notable prior works  **Cast**: Maria Bakalova, Amandla Stenberg, Pete Davidson, Rachel Sennott, Lee Pace  **Plot**: A group of friends party at a summer home during a storm and murderous chaos ensues.  **Thoughts**: Some may not believe this is a comedy, but it has some pretty funny moments. Every character is unlikeable. but that is intentional. Gets intense at times compared to the rest of the list.  **Runtime**: 1h 34m   **Streaming**: Digital VOD  # 4. Chip 'n Dale: Rescue Rangers  **Director**: Akiva Schaffer - Popstar: Never Stop Never Stopping, Hot Rod  **Cast**: Andy Samberg, John Mulaney, Will Arnet, J.K. Simmons, Seth Rogen  **Plot**: Live action take on the famous TV chipmunks. The duo reunite to find their friend.  **Thoughts**: Surprisingly funny and a decent mystery. Plenty of meta humor and pop culture references. Overall a very easy and enjoyable watch.  **Runtime**: 1h 37m   **Streaming**: Disney+  # 5. Death on the Nile  **Director**: Kenneth Branagh - Murder on the Orient Express, Belfast, Cinderella  **Cast**: Kenneth Branagh, Gal Gadot, Armie Hammer, Annette Benning, Russell Brand  **Plot**: Famed detective Hercule Poirot tries to solve a murder during a couple's honeymoon in Egypt.  **Thoughts**: Not too comedic, but adding it to the list because if I didn't every comment would mention it. Decent enough take on the Agatha Christie novel, if slightly over long and possibly predictable.  **Runtime**: 2h 7m   **Streaming**: Hulu  # 6. See How They Run  **Writer/Director**: Mark Chappell/Tom George - no notable prior works  **Cast**: Sam Rockwell. Saoirse Ronan, Ruth Wilson, Adrien Brody, David Oyelowo  **Plot**: The director of an upcoming film adaptation of a famous play is murdered after the 100th show.  **Thoughts**: Light and easy to watch. Rockwell and Ronan do well with what they are given. There are a couple of decent twists and turns, but overall it is a pretty run of the mill murder mystery.  **Runtime**: 1h 38m   **Streaming**: HBO Max  # 7. Amsterdam  **Writer/Director**: David O. Russell - The Fighter, Silver Linings Playbook, American Hustle  **Cast**: Christian Bale, Margot Robbie, John David Washington, Rami Malek, Robert DeNiro  **Plot**: Two WW1 Vets and their friend try to figure out who may have killed their general from the war.  **Thoughts**: The reviews will likely make it seem worse than it is. The runtime did not seem to drag and the performances were good, but it is a bit goofier and more complicated than it needed to be.  **Runtime**: 2h 14m   **Streaming**: Digital VOD  # 8. Scream  **Writer/Director**: Tyler Gillett/Matt Bettinelli-Olpin - Ready or Not, V/H/S  **Cast**: Melissa Barrera, Jack Quaid, David Arquette, Neve Campbell, Courtney Cox  **Plot**: The Ghostface killer is back for a fifth time to kill some teens in Woodsboro, CA.  **Thoughts**: Some suspenseful moments, but still plenty of laughs. Does it rehash a lot from the original Scream? Sure. Does its meta spin on the material still keep you entertained? I thought so.  **Runtime**: 1h 54m   **Streaming**: Showtime  # 9. Enola Holmes 2  **Writer/Director**: Harry Bradbeer -Enola Holmes, Fleabag  **Cast**: Millie Bobby Brown, Henry Cavill, Helena Bohnham Carter, David Thewlis  **Plot**: Sherlock Holmes' teen sister opens her own detective agency and investigates a missing girl.  **Thoughts**: There definitely was a few cringy moments in this one. It also seems slightly more interested in romance and setting up sequels than in solving mystery. Still fast paced and enjoyable.  **Runtime**: 2h 9m   **Streaming**: Netflix  # 10. The Bob's Burgers Movie  **Writer/Director**: Loren Bouchard - Bob's Burgers, Central Park  **Cast**: H. Jon Benjamin, Kristen Schaal, Dan Mintz, John Roberts, Eugene Mirman  **Plot**: A sinkhole in front of the Belcher family's burger restaurant leads to a complicated mystery.  **Thoughts**: Pretty light on the mystery, but an easy watch especially if you are familiar with the TV show. It won't change your life, but it's a good enough way to spend a couple hours on a lazy Sunday.  **Runtime**: 1h 42m   **Streaming**: Hulu  &#x200B;  ***Honorable Mentions:***  # Only Murders in the Building - Season 2  **Creators**: John Hoffman & Steve Martin - The Jerk, Bowfinger, The Pink Panther  **Cast**: Steve Martin, Martin Short, Selena Gomez, Tina Fey, Cara Delevingne  **Plot**: The murders keep on piling up as a second murder requires the trio to continue their podcast.  **Thoughts**: Hard to recommend to watch if you haven't seen the first season, but if Whodunits are your thing, then watch that too. Martin and Short crush it, and the mysteries are really well constructed.  **Runtime**: 5h 37m   **Streaming**: Hulu  # The Afterparty  **Creator**: Christopher Miller - 21/22 Jump Street, The Lego Movie, Clone High  **Cast**: Sam Richardson, Tiffany Haddish, Ben Schwartz, Zoe Chao, Ike Barinholtz  **Plot**: After a high school reunion, friends all go to the after party of a now famous classmate.  **Thoughts**:  Great show to binge in a single afternoon. Each episode is from a different POV . They experiment with a few genres which doesn't always work, it had me guessing until the end.  **Runtime**: 3h 56m   **Streaming**: Apple TV+"

This was a banger, an “epic” in the true sense.  Orlando Bloom plays Balian, who after the loss of his wife, finds his seeking out redemption in Jerusalem and the politics that lie there. He learns what it means to be a knight.  I was expecting a lopsided depiction of events, as Hollywood does as usual. But I thought Ridley Scott did a fair job in displaying this historical event, from all sides. There were some issues/critiques of course, but I can respect the effort Ridley Scott made. It's only a shame that there are not more epic films made like this: powerful, moving, grandiose, large action, meaningful, spiritual, historical, well acted, shot and soundtracked.  Despite any flaws, this film was a 10/10 for me because of the art of filmmaking that went into this movie. The details and precision could be felt. It had a meaningful journey that was depicted really well, the writing/dialogue was superb."

They captured New York City exactly the way the city is, stunts and actions exaggerated like anime, vibrant colors and effects. It's also has a lot of romance which I was really enjoying. I loved how Timothee Chalamet and Ty Dolla $ign had such subtle and awesome roles. The music was perfect for all applicable scenes.

Also, after finishing the film and finding out about the whole luring women in stuff, it makes sense in my eyes that they would've tried to kill Frank had he not been infected. Due to him having a daughter, and looking quite strong. Probably someone the army folk wouldn't like to mess with as they'd know he'd intervene with their plans sooner than Jim.  \\- 2 questions, why do the soldiers only come out when Frank is infected? And would they have killed Frank had he not been infected there at the checkpoint/later on?  Sorry this was a long clutter of text for 2 simple questions, I just enjoyed the film very much"

But there is one movie I am grateful my childhood stayed away from…  Why do I hate “A Christmas Story?”  - It's a movie from the 80s set in the 40s. F. Right there. Keeping the film set in contemporary times would have really helped. Especially with commercialism boom. If Ralphie's big toy still needed to be a pellet gun, that's fine. Kids of the 80s played with those. - That stupid rabbit suit, that Stupid lamp, that stupid tongue freezing pole. All the subplots are dumb and at nothing to the “Christmas Story.” - I hate this movie so much. The “Story” during Christmas time is just awful and if Ralphie is supposed to be learning a lesson, he isn't. “You will shoot you eye out” is repeated every ten minute to not only Ralphie, but to us. IT WONT STOP. Ralphie imagines it, it happens in reality. Every chance Ralphie tries to speak he is answered by the same tired line… and I wouldn't have cared that much if RALPHIE WAS LEARNING A LESSON. But nope. After being told “No” and “You'll Shoot your eye out” more times than is appropriate to a child during WW2, Ralphie STILL GETS THE BB GUN. And what does he do? RECOIL SHOOT NEAR HIS EYE AND BREAK HIS GLASSES.  Wish Ralphie instead shot at the Bunny suit or the Leg Lamp."

It was probably true, it doesn't take away from the fact she was the best in her day, being the 1930s and 40s.   When Bette Davis didn't say anything, and her face was how she expressed her emotions, she was incredible. In BORDERTOWN, she depicts her character's increasing insanity in the most subtle way possible. An entire sequence devoted to her worrying face and she nails it.   In IN THIS OUR LIFE, she plays a Southern Belle who steals her sister's husband and turns to murder when her spoiled whims never satisfy her. A scene of her running from the cops and glancing at her rearview mirror, it's the best kind of acting I've seen in Film.   When Bette Davis came to the scene, nobody was like her. Actresses wanted to be pretty and never wanted to play villains. Bette Davis embraced challenging parts, she wanted to act and the more difficult a role was, the more she wanted it. Her performance in OF HUMAN BONDAGE was groundbreaking, it was the part of a tramp destroyed by her selfishness and later, syphylis. Nobody wanted to play the part of Mildred Rogers, Bette Davis took it and it changed everything for her."

A prerecorded message played saying The Interview had been banned in the US and I was going to be prosecuted. They said I could leave a brief defense on a voicemail and then a beep occurred. I muttered something about it being in Neflix and hung up.   Not a soul knew I was watching that movie. I called Neflix, told them what happened and asked if it was a gimmick. The person on the phone was confused and said it wasn't illegal and they didn't release the streaming data of their customers.  I hope this is allowed by the Mods.

        "label": null,
        "body": "(This was my first time ever watching this movie, Im curious what ya'll think about it too :) ) [SPOILERS for a film that came out in 1982]    Blade Runner: The Final Cut is a very Dystopian-Noir futuristic film, featuring Harrison Ford as the main character, Decker, who is a retired LAPD Officer tasked with finding 4 “Replicants” to execute them for their crimes against humanity. Going into this film, I expected it to be a much more solemn, slower, melancholic story, but to my surprise I was wrong. I guess that's on me, since I should have known it would be more action-packed since Harrison Ford plays the main character. A few points I want to talk about in the film, which I think are important to discuss, are as follows:  The Acting The Action The Directing/Choices of the Director  Lets start with #1, the Acting. For a film with one of its core concepts being “Replicants” that are supposed to be “More Human than Human”, they don't seem to fit in at all with the society that is portrayed in the film. The “Replicants” who are just Synthetic Humans, their whole purpose is to blend into society, but they do the exact opposite. Evade people's personal space, talk in weird fashions, stare at people for abnormal amounts of time, and overall weird behavioral tendencies that no human should have. But, I realized that that's the whole point of the Replicants. They only have 4 years to live, and near the end of their lifespan, they start to develop actual emotions. Fear, Hate, Love, etc… you know the drift. The whole reason they were acting weird in the first place was because they realized that they weren't human and were slowly realizing that they were dying. It makes a lot more sense when you think of it like that, and it holds a lot more depth and understanding to the story and characters. That is good writing, if I do say so myself.  Now onto #2, The Action. The action segments in this movie aren't too far in between, so it's not boring in any way shape or form. The thing about it, is that its brutally gruesome in certain segments. (SPOILER WARNING) There are 4 Replicants on the loose. Rachel, Leon, Pris, and Roy. Skipping forward near the end of the film, Decker heads into Sebastian's apartment, to only find nothing but toys and disgusting abominations. This leads to Decker finding Pris (a “Pleasure” bot) and shoots her in the stomach as she is back flipping over him. She squirms on the floor and screams loudly, before Decker shoots her again. Her screams and squirms get louder before she inevitably stops and dies. The very next scene is Roy (the last Replicant that Decker kills) coming up on the Elevator and finding that Decker killed Pris. Roy tells Decker that she was nearing the end of her lifespan, and they were trying to find a way to live forever. Which went out the window, when Roy killed both Sebastian and Tyrell, the genius which created the Replicants in the first place by poking his eyes out. Roy and Decker have a long-ish cat and mouse fight, before they end up on the rooftops. Decker tries to scale the building and jump to the next one, but barely hangs on by his 8 fingers since Roy broke the other 2 in their fight. Decker is about to fall off the building, but Roy saves him from his impending doom. They have a little talk about the Replicants and having to feel emotions. This is a very profound scene in the large action segment, with Roy explaining that he wanted to show Decker, a human, what its like for a Replicant to feel that same feeling every single day until their eventual “retirement”. Roy shows his last bit of humanity as he powers down and dies in front of Decker, showing that not only are all Replicants bad, per say, but they are also human as well, in a metaphorical sense. That is just so… profound.  And finally #3, The Direction. Ridley Scott, the director of this movie, has done more than just Blade Runner: The Final Cut. He has done the classic “Alien” and many more. Specifically, we are going to be looking at those 2 that I mentioned, since they came out around the same time. Those 2 movies have some similarities and differences, the obvious one I wanted to point out was the use of Technology. The film is set in 2019 Los Angeles, aside from the flying cars and laser pistols, the Technology is sorta… *dated*. Although this may seem like a bit picky thing to complain about, I'm not complaining. In fact, this choice from Ridley Scott Revolutionized the entire Sci-Fi Genre as we know it. I'm both Alien and Blade Runner: The Final Cut, there are many scenes with extremely old computers, with basic grids and can only do basic functions. But, the functions they carry out in the films are extraordinary for their time. For example, there is a scene in Blade Runner where Decker enhances a photo a couple times, speaking to the computer how many grid spots it moves, where to center the camera, telling the computer to pan to the left or right, enhancing the quality, etc… all things that you more than likely couldn't do on an old Macintosh-style computer from the early 80's. Both movies use this style of technology for the “future” settings, using what little they had at the time and enhancing it through editing or what have you. This is what I call, Oxymoronic Analog Technology, or OAT for short. Using *old* technology with *new* enhancements and functions, making it seem futuristic. Ridley Scott might have not come up with the OAT Concept, but he for sure made it a staple in 2 of the most revolutionary Sci-Fi Films of the 20th Century, changing the entire course of the Sci-Fi Film Genre as we know it.  So even if it is a film about Harrison Ford murdering Synthetic Humans, at the end of the day it's a revolutionary film that deserves its recognition as one of the forefathers of the Sci-Fi Genre and so does Ridley Scott as well."

Some movies were contractually obligated to make a sequel or lose money. 3. Some studios get lazy on the 3rd installment and make a subpar movie compared to the first 2. (ie. The Godfather 1 & 2, The Terminator 1 & 2, TMNT 1&2 They all had 2 great first installments but the third felt forced or unnecessarily lazy.)  Also they just made a sequel to RIPD which was a horrible train wreck and no one asked for a sequel. Seems like a contractual obligation movies to me so they wouldn't lose more money or whatever."

They projected the zoom meeting on screen and we got to listen in on what felt like a really close and personal interview.   The dude is so cool. His history with making films, his passion for storytelling and stop-motion in particular (having started in stop motion), his down to earth perspective. He's the kind of filmmaker that just makes going to the movies the best. Even spoke a bit about Cabinet of Curiosities, too!   'Pinocchio,' was just something else. Beautiful, deeply emotional story. Some incredible stop motion animation. A completely new take on Pinocchio's story. One thing that surprised me—it's really funny too! Some great VA performances from a star-studded cast. Just so much to love. It is definitely a more mature film than other executions, but not necessarily inappropriate for older kids.  If you get the chance to see it in theaters I really recommend it. So much love went into making this thing, it was just fantastic.  Anyways, thought I'd share about that cool moviegoing experience. Check it out."

Sometimes a story wants to be set in a dream — not just to use surreal imagery or 'dream-logic,' but to actually be set inside one or more interconnected dreams within the text of the narrative.   *Inception* is the classic example of a movie that says it's going to do this and never actually bothers — that movie feels like it's set in a series of rather logical interconnected video game levels, with our only concession to the 'dream' concept being some pilfered Satoshi Kon imagery and a scene where a cityscape goes foldy-foldy. This is not a query about *Inception.*  My two live-action visual touchstones for stories set in dreams are *Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind*, particularly the last third, and the Buffy episode *Restless.* These are not only set largely in dreams within the narrative and progress using some amount of 'dream-logic,' but also go to some lengths to achieve the texture and dizzying 'feel' of being in a dream.   Because I don't know shit about fuck, and am not as ciné-literate as I should be… what are some other examples that you think are as good or better? They should be 1) live action, 2) explicitly set in a dream within the narrative, and 3) really try to *feel* like dreams to match their narrative pretensions.

I vaguely remember other scenes like this, lost in the slightly fermented recesses of my brain - but I would like to find them again. Watching those just makes me feel... better. For a while.  I haven't been very lucky with Google. Maybe Google is so saturade with meaningless copy-paste best of lists or my english competency is failing me. But I can't find a seach term that would result in something remotely related to what I am looking for. Either its best entrance of actor/character (which I am fond of as well - looking at you, Aragorn) or... uh... other entrances. Again, not opposed in principle but neither is what I am looking for specifically.  Long story short, a two-part question:  1. What are your most impressive, epic, goose-bump inducing mass entrance scenes in a movie (I dare you, I double dare you - you KNOW what I mean!) 2. How would you go about to search for them? What's the proper term?  Desperate & Thankful  Me. Cheers!  P.S. I also vaguely remember something with motorcycles. Lots of bikes appearing over the horizon. No idea where from. Anybody?  Edit: **The Cavalry arrives!** That... that was the term I was looking for. Thank you all for the help and the great contributions.  &#x200B;"

Why would the Shark even go after her? Like, it's as if the writers saw ORCA and decided that it was a good plot. Also, Michael Caine's role is such an oddity, he's just there to be a love interest.   I actually didn't mind the other characters. I appreciated that this movie focused more on the human story instead of it just being shark vs humans. And they did cast good actors like Karen Young and Mario Van Peebles and Judith Barsi.   I don't feel this is the worst of the series. I think 3D is a lot worse."

        "body": "The following are recalled from memory and factual errors are expected.  I am familiar to the fan theory that the 1996 film, The Rock, was a homage to the Bond films. I have read two separate publications, that once their information were to be pieced together eventually convinced me that The Rock was secretly a Bond fan film by people who love and adore Sean Connery and the James Bond films without in any way shape or form infringed on the intellectual property rights of Eon Productions.  Regardless of the lie or truth, I have enjoyed the films.  Years pass and the 2021 film, No Time To Die was finally released. I made sure to not to be spoiled and came to watch the movie with a fresh mind.  **Important!** Spoilers bellow to those who have not seen the movie *No Time To Die*. You have been **warned**!    There I was enjoying the movie. Somewhere at the first third of the movie, an old memory was suddenly recalled. I found the scene I was watching started to become familiar.  It was only a few minutes later and I realized that it was not the scene but the actors acting that reminded me of the characteristics of the characters that were played by Nicolas Cage and Sean Connery in the 1996 film, The Rock. In the next seconds, the boat sank.  I continued to watch and had a fun thought that the character played by Billy Magnussen was secretly or some sort of a homage to the character played by Nicolas Cage. But that can't be. That would be a legal problem. I then recalled that Daniel Craig always talked how extremely difficult it was to finally find a good script with what was to be his last run as James Bond. There was a lot of pressure and anticipation of a high quality script that made everyone satisfied. It would be crazy if they plagiarized another intellectual property, they only had the books and past films for inspirations.  As the movie progressed, I could not help but suspect the movie more and more. The next suspicion was the final meeting between James Bond and the character played by Billy Magnussen. The character was smiling and the way he was laughing and as his character was trapped and under the cross-hairs of James Bond. An American agent, smiling, that laugh, under orders, and a big fan of James Bond. Those describe almost accurately the character played by Nicolas Cage and how Sean Connery's character grated under the antics and behavior of Nicolas Cage's character.  There was no way this was possible, but the similarities did not end there. This also severely distracted me from enjoying the movie.  There was the daughter, the poison, the island, the concrete interior scenes, the action, the monologues, the eventual sacrifice, the lone character in black walking out to the open on top of a concrete structure, the signal, the fighter jets flying over, the very explosive bombs to neutralize the poison, the motivation of James Bond, and many more.  The explosions definitely reminded me of the over-the-top explosions usually found in the films of Jerry Bruckheimer and Michael Bay... The Rock was produced by Jerry Bruckheimer and directed by Michael Bay.  This speculation is crazy. Just the legal ramifications alone... But both rights holders are not suing each other even with a lot of evidence.  There is a precedent where something like this happened before. Dave Chappelle had a TV show, and one skit was about a true story of the musician known or formally known as Prince, basketball, and pancakes. Dave Chappelle and his team were worried by any legal reaction from Prince when the episode was released. There was none. Sometime later, Prince released an album, with the cover of a picture of Dave Chappelle dressed as Prince holding pancakes. Dave Chappelle did not sue Prince, just as Prince did not sue Dave Chappelle.  Thank you for reading."
