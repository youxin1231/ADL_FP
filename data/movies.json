        "body": "So I recently watched the movie 'Split' and while I did enjoy watching the movie, I feel it wasn't for the right reasons. Sometimes the character's actions looked outright dumb to me (for example: the 3 victims not ganging up on the child alter together, the main character looking directly at her kidnapper instead of literally getting out of the car immediately instead of attempting to when it's too late etc.) The way that DID was portrayed also felt really weird since I happen to know a few things about the disorder (took a course in human sciences in high school). The beast alter was hilarious to me in the way that he was almost worshipped by the collective and also the line at the end where he says something among the lines of the broken are the more evolved. The way that each alter also always changes into different clothes also came across as something that didn't make a lot of sense to me in terms of how accurate it was with the disorder but this was probably done so that the viewer's weren't too confused about who was fronting (in the light as they say in the movie) at the time. Sometimes the way DID was portrayed as being some kind of superpower also rubbed me the wrong way as well since it is a mental disorder that is formed through trauma and for people to see it as a superpower feels kind of dismissive of what the actual disorder is and it also feels as if people with DID are portrayed as monsters because of this. Overall this movie made me laugh more than anything and I didn't realize it was a psychological horror until I looked up reviews of the movie. It also has a surprisingly high rating which left me guessing if I even watched the same movie as these people who left positive reviews.   Are there any people who share my sentiment or who can convince me otherwise?",

        "body": "Hey.  Hope you're doing well.  One thing I've always believed for a really iconic role is the actor makes the role, not the other way around. You put a hopeless actor in there and most people will focus on their flaws rather than the story being played out on the screen. They don't commend your attention in a good way.  I'm sure we can agree that in a lot of movies we can probably imagine at least a handful of actors play the lead role, possibly with different interpretations.   But which movies (and franchises) can you imagine only the actor cast as the one and only person playing the part?  I'm thinking Al Pacino as Michael Corleone in The Godfather and Tom Cruise as Ethan Hunt in Mission: Impossible as a couple examples of movies/franchises that rely on both actors in their roles for large parts to deliver in every scene and people view these actors epitomizing these characters. You put Harrison Ford (or another competent actor great in action movies), for example, in the role of Ethan Hunt, it could fail or underwhelm because he isn't Ethan Hunt and doesn't feel like he embodies the character.   This is not a question of best acting ability but perfect acting for the particular role they're playing.",

It's plot follows a group of strangers in the early 70s at the El Royale hotel that rests on the border of California and Nevada with a large red line dividing it down the middle. And when shit hits the fan, we follow each character's perspective to what's going on.  This movie is written and directed by Drew Goddard who wrote The Martian and Cabin in the Woods (which he also directed) and this movie is on par with those if not better, imo.  Featuring an ensemble cast with Jon Hamm, Lewis Pullman, Jeff Bridges, Lewis Pullman, Dakota Johnson, Cynthia Erivo, Cailee Spaeny, and Chris Hemsworth. All of them put in amazing performances. But specifically Erivo and Pullman put in performances that are absolutely breathtaking.  The plot and script is interesting and unique with twists and symbolism so well done it definitely warrants a rewatch. Its direction and cinematography rocks, providing a neo-noir look. And it has a killer soundtrack featuring even a deep purple song.  This is a must watch for anyone who enjoys mystery thrillers. 9/10.",

I'm using cinema in the terms of a film made by an artist that wants to tell a story where art, craft and story take precedence over profit concerns, or cultural trends.  I don't believe cinema is dead, nor that it ever will die, but it doesn't seem to grab the public at large as much as it did in the past.  Unless we see a major Hollywood collapse I don't foresee anything like the 70's ever occurring again where directors with unique vision are given the freedom to experiment with the form.     Also society has changed a lot.  We probably live in one of the most draconian times when it comes to creators and artists being given the freedom to express themselves in all genres of artistic expression.  Art has become a democratic process where everyone feels they have the right to tell artists what stories to tell and how to tell them.  It's really difficult to imagine a Kubrick, Lynch or Coppola flourishing today.",

It does not contain any spoilers.  &#x200B;  I was looking up some of the trivia around *Glass Onion* and *Knives Out* (which, you may have heard, were good movies).  One of the things Rian Johnson mentioned was that bad guys were not allowed to use Apple product placement. Johnson couldn't show his villain using an iPhone in *Knives Out*, although there was a tongue-in-cheek reference to this rule in *Glass Onion*.  The rule seems stupid to me. Lots of villains tend to have expensive, luxurious things. I would fully expect Hans Gruber from *Die Hard* to have a much more expensive stuff than John McClane. Gruber wears an extremely nice suit, and McClane spends most of the movie in a cheap-looking tank top. Its part of McClane's character that he is insecure that his wife's career is much more successful than his own.  I bet some watch company paid a lot of money to get Alan Rickman to wear their watch, and that it turned out to be a sensible marketing decision, because rich people would be very happy to own Hans Gruber's watch.  &#x200B;  Do you think that you would be more, or less willing to buy something that was used by a rich baddie compared to a working-class hero? What if both hero and villain were both expected to have ridiculously expensive and beautiful things? Like in a Bond movie.",

Warrior (2010)  Of all the Fighting Movies I've ever seen (including Rocky) this is absolutely the best. Honest brotherly termoil has never been done better and it is the first movie in my adult life to let me cry  2. Rocky/Rambo (1976/1982)  If I thought I was wrong about Jim Carrey, holy cow was I wrong about Sly. He puts in phenomenal performances which carry both movies. I know it was bashed at the time but Rambo's breakdown about the hardships of being a soldier is absolutely brilliant. Rocky surprised me quite a bit by being surprisingly actionless, and fantastic for it (its sequels do not carry this quality). Rocky himself might be one of my favourite protagonists in movie history.  3. Eternal Sunshine/Truman Show (2004/1994)  I somehow haven't seen many Jim Carrey movies. These two were both great though. High concept feel good movies that'd deserve all the praise they get.  4. Burn (2019)  I shouldn't love this movie as much as I do but the story of a lowly robber getting kidnapped by a girl incel is just fun. The location is fantastic as well, love one location films  5. Murder on Orient Express (2017)  I watched a lot of murder mysteries recently, and while Glass Onion, Death On The Nile and See How They Run are all good none of them beat This beautifully picturesque murder mystery.  6. Bullet Train (2022)  This is one of the funniest action movies I've ever seen. Nuf said  7. The Batman/Spiderman No Way Home (2022)  Of the two big comic movies I watched this year, I probably preferred The Batman (I'm a Batman fan, sue me). I did enjoy both though and they both seemed to try harder than a lot of other recent comic movies  8. No Child Of Mine (1997) (technically a mini series but who's counting)  An absolutely heart wrenching story about a young girl repeatedly abused by people who are supposed to protect her which is based on a true story. I bring the plot up because the acting of the lead actress is the greatest piece of child acting I've ever seen and I would highly recommend to anyone looking to go on an emotional journey    9. The Big Sleep (1946)  As far as very old movies, this is the one I watched and loved the most. Still holds up for the dialogue alone. No wonder it was such an inspiration  10. Jungleland (2019)  I think I'm a Charlie Hunnam Stan. This movie was like watching a funeral. Still thought it was great. Also BKB is badass  Also I watched through Snyder's filmography and it was passable",

Since March I've actually been watching more live action  indies because I think this year you're now  seeing how much the  Disney/Fox merger and the pandemic really affected live action movies as far as what's getting made and how some of them are being treated.    I didn't like the direction of  the major studios are going since everyone is  either leeching off of IP's more than ever, dumping mid budget films to streaming and  some of the original films that did get made and released to theaters a majority of them felt like it's doing the same old things that movies in the the last 50 years have done better.  But I gotta say I feel like indies are really going to reach a peak of popularity in the next couple of years. Heck, maybe we'll eventually see an A24 film gross $100 million dollars in the domestic box office.",

Personally I think a Christopher Nolan project in a show would be nice. He tends to overestimates the intelligence of his audience. His films such as Inception could have been better as a show.

Holy shit am i sure glad we are somewhat of an obscene family and watch a lot of movies together. There were probably about a total of 25 people in the theater, to begin. About thirty minutes in i ran to the bathroom and as i came out there was a family that had been in the theater with us that decided to leave, it was maybe 3 middle aged women, an older woman, two young children and a middle aged guy. i overhead the oldest woman say “i knew it was gonna be rated R but i had no idea it was going to be that explicit”. okay miss lady why are you bringing kids under the age of 10 to a rated R movie and expecting to to not be explicit? got a good hoot out of me. mind you i'm sure after the split second scene of an elephants asshole opening up really sent them on their way. Went back in the theater and endured the most boobs i have ever seen on christmas. the women sitting in front of me were visibly and audibly grossed out whenever a same-sex kiss was shared on screen and whined to their husbands. The crowds reaction really got me because it was so integral to the experience of the film.   The film itself had me laughing nonstop at some points. it was really crude humor but i like that stuff. the plot was kind of messy and i didn't really like Nellie's character arc just because i felt like we missed so much of it. Tobey's character was fucking horrifying, but he did a great job. the whole sequence in LA's asshole was deeeply disturbing. Manny was an interesting character i just wish that they would have made him less main-character trope-y. Mr. Conrad was a great representation of big star hollywood in my opinion, i think it was somewhat direct satire of leo, johnny, george, that lot. the last thirty minutes of the film felt sooo unnecessary. the climax had already happened and it was just about reiterating a point that films live forever.   overall, there was zero moments of peace in this movie, it's just go go go and everlasting clusterfuck of chaos. although i wasn't bored i can't quite argue that i was entertained. 6/10 wouldn't watch again.",

        "body": "The Edge of Tomorrow (or Live, Die, Repeat) has a plot hole relating to the rules of the movie's time travel and who remembers the details of the previous alternate timeline. A recent discussion on r/movies of major plot holes reminded me of this, and I've never seen it brought up here. Perhaps I'm overthinking a dumb but fun action movie (with an admittedly interesting premise) but it always bothered me.   For those who need a refresher of the plot, the movie revolves around an alien invasion of Earth. The aliens have humanity on the brink of defeat until Tom Cruise's character gains access to the aliens' secret weapon; time-travel. Due to the protagonist getting alien blood in a wound, any time that Tom Cruise's character dies, time rewinds to a set point the prior day. Cruise's character still possess all memory of his prior life, allowing him to reattempt the same challenges with more and more practice. Importantly, no other character is aware of the rewinding of time. In other words, the protagonist effectively has a video game checkpoint with infinite lives.   The plot hole arrives with the introduction of Emily Blunt's character, who like the protagonist, also had the groundhog day-esque checkpoint. I specifically say had, as she claims to have lost her check point ability due to a blood-transfusion she received after a battle.   However, her knowing this information doesn't make any sense. The only way for a character to know if they have this checkpoint is to die, and subsequently experience time-rewinding. So if she lost her ability, she would just die expecting for time to rewind, and then that wouldn't happen. Plus, per the movies rules, she would have no recollection of the previous attempts and rewinds. Later in the film, she even gets frustrated that the protagonist is using his attempts to also try to seduce her, without her knowledge. So to her knowledge, she would believe she still has the ability and wouldn't be weary about blood transfusions (another plot point). Admittedly, I believe the protagonist could inform her that she lost her ability but to my recollection, this isn't done in the film.   Let me know if there is a deleted scene that explains this away or if there are any holes in my logic here. However, this plot hole did somewhat bother me even though Emily Blunt's character obviously also serves to deliver exposition about the movie's universe. I know it's pretty nit-picky, but I thought I'd share regardless.  **TLDR: In Edge of Tomorrow, Emily Blunt's character wouldn't know she lost her checkpoint ability. She would just die with the expectation of respawning.**",

In the last scene of the movie he was in the cinema and all those people he met in the movie were also there who talked to him (just another vision or dream or whatever i guess)  &#x200B;  Does anyone recognise this movie?

I did not connect or relate to any of the characters as I felt the daughter character went through similar tropes to all girls in coming of age films, (wanting to grow up quicker, desiring romantic intimacy with other people her age, not quite grasping adult issues but knowing they exist) and I feel as if her arc progresses in a predictable manner. More importantly however, I feel as if the dad is a genuinely unlikable character. I hated how petty, childish, and openly resentful he was to having a daughter so young. He did a terrible job hiding his issues with his daughter and instead of better emphasizing with his daughter and making her feel loved, he continued to wallow in his self pity and abandoned her altogether. I read that it's implied that he killed himself but that doesn't make sense to me because I'm sure she would know her dad is dead or at least has disappeared from the face of the earth after that trip. Regardless, I don't feel sympathy for him. I myself struggle with massive depression but I could never walk away from my responsibilities as a parent to a daughter I don't even live with. Oh woe is me you're broke, most parents are! That doesn't give you the right to walk away. And the ending suggesting Sophie understands where her father is coming from is upsetting. He doesn't deserve forgiveness for abandoning a daughter that desperately needed her father's approval. Honestly, I think the biggest issue I had with the film was how formulaic it felt. In no instance did I feel like these events could actually transpire in real life, and it instead felt like some pretentious artsy film a failing NYU grad student would make to boost their grade. I much prefer a movie like the Whale, where all the characters are flawed but have depth and complex reasonings to their actions, that allows you to grow a connection to the characters. As cheesy as that film can be at times, there's an emotional core that's missing from Aftersun.  I understand I'm in the minority here, but I would love to read other's opinions and interpretations so I can better understand what people love about this film.",

There were numerous times where they were unprotected and the characters had every reason to fight back (most notably when Pearl slept in Maxine's bed). Im not gonna be scared of some old geezers who almost get taken out by the recoil of a shotgun and get heart attacks by being scared of a dead body. The cast was weak too since all of the characters were either horny teenagers or horny old people. That being said, I did love Pearl a lot and im looking foward to seeing Maxxxine.  Avatar just felt like the same movie as the first one. Same plot, same villian, same overly cheesy and at times even cringy dialogue, etc. And my god it just would not end. I thought it would end like 5 times but they just kept on dragging it. They could've trimmed the final fight by 30 minutes but they needlessly stretched it out.

        "body": "I've just been watching Matilda the Musical on Netflix and thinking how well produced, delightful it is and how wonderfully Tim Minchin-esque the songs are - and I basically thought Roald Dahl probably would have hated this.  Now Dahl is known as a curmudgeonly old git - which would be endearing (and probably why his books are so good and darkly humorous) if it wasn't for the fact he was an anti-semite, which is heartbreaking when his children's books are so funny, touching and generally have an inspiring message - especially Matilda. Anyway, putting this knowledge to one side, I can't help sympathising with the reasons he hates some of his most well-known adaptations of his children's stories.  There's a dark British edge running through his stories. His adult stories, which are unashamedly dark and sinister, were made into Roald Dahl's Tales of the Unexpected (1979-88) which he had a lot of involvement in. They were straight adaptions of his works. So I can see why he would have admired them.  Now his children's stories were totally different kettle of fish.   Willy Wonka & The Chocolate Factory (1971) is a beloved film. It came out at an era when musicals were popular so unsurprisingly it was a musical.  I can understood why Dahl would have hated it. It's not a straight adaption of his work.   It's Americanized - Dahl wanted UK national treasure Spike Milligan to play Wonka, which I think many of his can agree could have been an equally exceptional portrayal as Gene Wilder's take on the character. The title is changed and more emphasis is out on Wonka over Charlie. Plus, Dahl hated the songs which he called saccharine, sappy and sentimental.   Plus, plot changes are made. After Dahl's death, his second wife said: they always want to change a book's storyline. What makes Hollywood think children want the endings changed for a film, when they accept it in a book?  She's got a point.  For him, the film must have felt like a butchering of one of his greatest works.   Now with the 1990 adaption of The Witches, Dahl disliked the film, and regarded it as utterly appalling and although he praised Huston's performance as the Grand High Witch, he was critical of the ending that contrasted with his book. >!This is in reference to the main character, who is turned into a mouse, being turned back into a boy at the end in the film. In the book, he remains a mouse.!<   Now I happen to think this ending ruins one of Dahl's most deliciously dark and haunting endings. It completely revises that tale for probably most of the children who would have experienced it, I can see why he would have gone berserk over it. Plus, it's effectively the film heads telling probably the most respected and popular children's authors of all time that his endings didn't work for children - which leaves a cold taste  in the mouth.  Now one adaption he did apparently like was the animated film The BFG (1989). It's a very straight adaption of his work. The only straight adaption of his lifetime.   He died in 1990. His widow said he would have loved Henry Sellick's James and the Giant Peach (1996) - which I find quite interesting since it instills that dark comical tone of Dahl's writing.  So do we agree?  Does anyone have more stories to tell about Dahl?",

He doesn't seem like he is trying to make sudden movements with his fingers in order to roll. Thing's movements always feel like he still has the forearm to move it around. But yeah. I think I am reading too much into it.

Honestly, Patrick played by Casey Affleck is such an arrogant POS. The whole thing has just triggered me insanely. Let me explain why. *Spoilers alert*  So, Patrick murders a guy - albeit a child abuser - and washes away his internalised guilt and sin by admitting it was wrong and saying he wouldn't do it again. In this case, for Patrick at least, breaking the law is something one should be able to get away with.   Now, this isn't a debate about whether the child abuser should have been able to live or not. Just remember that in Patrick's world, the only right way is his way. Of course, he doesn't turn himself in. Why would he? He apologised to himself and the Lord so he's fine with that.  As the plot develops, it turns out the missing girl is alive and well. She's been taken in a plot by the girl's uncle and the police to remove her from her drug addict mother. Now, Patrick was right - they should have called social services. But they didn't.   Despite Patrick seeing how happy the girl is, how happy the police officer looking after her is (his daughter was killed so this intervention/kidnapping is personal on a deep level of wanting to help the girl) and his girlfriend begging him not to call the authorities - what does ol' Patrick go and do?   Well, in Patrick's mind there even being a slim chance that the girl's drug addict mother can change her ways means they must return the girl. But, let's be honest - in the real world it's wishful thinking. The sensible and rational thing to do would be to leave everything as is and walk away. But not for Patrick, oh no.  The guy who just murdered someone is now oh so holier than thou. He is the arbiter of justice and moral standing. So, taking a huge gamble on the girl's future, he calls the police and that's that. For me, the wild arrogance of this guy is unbearable. To get that far into a movie and see the protagonist turn out to be such a POS is infuriating.   What's even more annoying is that his choice is then validated as the girl's mother goes clean from drugs. But it was a gamble and perfectly encapsulates how he frivolously plays around with people's lives depending on which way the wind blows. Yeah, his girlfriend leaves him - thank god. But, this guy is such an odious douchebag for me at this point I half wanted him to get murdered by one of guys he upset in a bar at the beginning.",

I was a kid when MiB first aired and I can definitely say that, while it is an old movie, it holds up pretty well nowadays. It may be nostalgia, but I remember loving this one along with Jurassic Park, independence Day and heck Space Jam?   I had, however, never watched 2 and 3. I remember 2 being pretty hyped up and talked about but never actually had the time to catch it. It's ehm a pretty weird movie, feels very much like something more for the kids rather than for everyone, I didn't like it honestly, Will's rap at the end was pretty solid though.  I wanted to talk about 3 though. I found it really good? i was expecting stuff to just get worse from 2 on out but if 1 is an 8 and 2 is a 5.5-6 I'd say 3 is a solid 7-7.5 imo. I was wondering why no one talks about this movie?  As for International, well I'm in the middle of watching it and wanted to write this while stuff was still fresh in my mind. MiBI is weird, I had a feeling it was going to be so when I first saw that they switched the penis guns for a more human designed gun. In so far it's really bland. Hope it didn't kill the franchise. MiBI could be a really cool tv series concept. Following other agents from around the globe kind of like the kids show.  Anyway what do you guys think about this franchise?",

I feel like the characters and their relationships in The Irishman are better than the ones in Goodfellas, and the story is much more emotionally potent. I know the length is an issue with a lot of people, but I actually liked how long it was. It helped flesh out the characters and their relationships. It is fitting for a story where you're following a character over decades of his life because by the end it genuinely feels like it, and it makes the ending of the film more powerful. My main complaint with the Irishman would be that the cgi isn't always perfect, and that in the scenes where Robert De Niro is supposed to be younger you can tell he is an older man (I think most people will know what specific scene I'm thinking of). However I think the story would not have been as powerful if they had different actors play the characters in their younger years, so those problems are worth it.   Part of the reason why I prefer The Irishman may be due to the fact that I saw the Irishman before I saw Goodfellas. I don't wanna say that the reason people prefer Goodfellas is due to nostalgia (though I feel like that plays a role), but due to the similarity in subject matter of the films I feel like you may resonate more with the one you saw first. I'm curious to see why people prefer Goodfellas, and also if anyone else feels the way I do.",

The fact that the Clue has only 68% approval rate on rotten tomatoes is ridiculous. We are talking about one of the best slapstick movies ever made, it should be there with the Airplane, Naked gun and many other classics, but for some reason people seem to over see the genious pure popcorn hilarity, that is the Clue!  Don't forget Rush Hour 2! This movie is one of the best buddy cop movies ever made. A perfect blend of cool action and funny dialogue, never forgetting the amazing chemistry between Chrish Tucker and Jackie Chan, but it only has 51% on rotten tomatoes, and critics elsewhere don't seem to get its beauty.  Movies aren't only about the depth of the characters or the performance, they are mostly about the feeling they generate on the viewer. This is something that the critics often forget. These two movies offer you an hour and a half that you'll never forget! They will take you on a ride that is most of all goofy, but in retrospect something very, very valluable... they made you forget your real life and took you into a world much like yours, but somehow different -as in a dream- and made you laugh and giggle like a schoolboy.  You could watch thousands of 12 years a slave, gravity, spotlight etc. But never arrvive to the same serenity as when watching something that is just FUN and GOOFY!

For example, Hades from Hercules has a lot of great qualities that make him an iconic and entertaining villain. He is hilarious, powerful, manipulative, and his reasoning for wanting to rule Mount Olympus makes me almost root for him cause of how the Gods gave him so much disrespect for no reason!

        "title": "In no particular order, what are your top ten films of 2022?",
        "body": "Not necessarily which movies are technically “the best”, but the ones you enjoyed the most.  For me the list would be:  - The Menu  Probably the best fictional single-handed takedown of an entire industry I've ever seen put to screen, and also one of the most interesting entries in the now-popular “class warfare” genre. There are no heroes in this movie, and it's all the better for it. Ralph Fiennes is fiendish as a villainous chef, and his idiot customers provide a generous helping of comic relief to what would otherwise be a quite dark movie.  - Bullet Train  Dumb action made smart, with a meticulously planned clockwork plot and one of the best ensemble casts of the year. Joey King once again proves how underrated she is as she plays a hatable villain with ease, and the celebrity cameos are impeccable. This is a movie that demands to be rewatched over and over, with the promise of finding a new, fun detail in it every time.  - The Whale  A powerful movie about trying to do the right thing and doing the exact wrong thing in the process. Darren Aronofsky manages to create an Uncut Gems level of anxiety inside a single, tiny apartment. A lot has been said about Brendan Fraser's stellar performance, but all the other main actors are just as stunning.  - Guillermo Del Toro's Pinocchio  The best animated film in a very, very, VERY long time. Del Toro outdoes every other version of the classic story by leagues as he makes bold, ridiculous changes to the text that would be laughed off in anyone else's hands but become transcendent within his, complicating the story's moral fabric and giving it new life.   - All Quiet On The Western Front  This film wants to make you angry, and it succeeds in spades. The pain and random death of ordinary soldiers on the front lines of WWI, history's most stupid, useless war, is brilliantly contrasted with the thumb-twiddling negotiations of privileged generals and diplomats more concerned with screwing each other over than ending the suffering.   - Nope  Jordan Peele returns in force with a meditation on the pursuit of fame and its consequences that's one part sci-fi, one part horror, and one part Greater L.A. legend. Steven Yeun steals the show with an unforgettable supporting arc that may be even more compelling than the main story.  - Elvis  Just like its namesake, this spot-on biopic is gaudy, theatrical, and full of thematic contradictions. Austin Butler gives a performance for the ages as he probes deep into The King's psyche to explore the vision that motivated him and the glaring flaws that led to his downfall. The film seems to never exhaust its supply of clever ways to underscore the sheer scope of Elvis's legacy, even as we see the man himself doubt it.  - Turning Red  One of the few big risks Pixar has taken in recent years, this film pays off. It's been a long time since Disney animated movies have had anything new to say about family relationships, but a transition of focus to the more strictly ordered structure of traditional Asian families allows director Domee Shi to explore interesting ideas about what parents and children owe to each other, and what they can learn from one another.  - The Batman  There have been many iterations of Batman over the years, but Matt Reeves gives us a new one: a Batman who's just plain wrong sometimes. As Robert Pattinson's Bruce Wayne tracks down Paul Dano's cleverly modernized Riddler (now an anti-government terrorist doing active recruitment on Reddit), he's forced to confront the numerous similarities between himself and the villains he fights. This may be the only movie ever where Batman decides to change for the better near the end, and that's not a bad thing in our broken age.  - X  Ti West gleefully takes a chainsaw to the erotic thriller in a movie so lowbrow that it's impossible to explain how it's still somehow high art to someone who's never seen it. Mia Goth excels in a dual role as a young, pretty woman and an old, homely one whose twisted obsession with the former drives the film's plot. The supporting cast is just fun, with Kid Cudi, Jenna Ortega, and more getting picked off one by one in a southern gothic-horror equivalent to “Home Alone”.   So there's my picks. All in all this was an incredible year in film, and I'm excited to see different movies pop up on everyone's list.",

Disney+ has the theatrical release but how easy would it be to have BOTH options?? Just give me the God damned touching song! The movie isn't as meaningful without it.   Looks like I'll have the 'ol VHS on stand by just for this.   Anyone else bothered by this?",

Pitch Black is still my favorite, I really like the monochromatic color scheme and simple plot that lands just right for me. The sets look good and the music theme is great. Riddick is almost the same movie in a different setting with Katee Sackoff this time and I think it's still great. Creature design is very cool, and again the action is quite satisfying with great looking sets.   Chronicles of Riddick is kind of a big budget outlier here with a stacked cast but still has his comic book panel looking shots where everything looks just how i want it to look.",

As I've gotten older, though, I've gained a major appreciation for it. So much so that I felt the need to post this.   I know it's not exactly a hot take to say this, but the movie is very well done and is such a nice, feels good, Christmas movie.   As a kid, the constant narration, 40s time frame, and slow pace put me off. I couldn't understand why mom and dad played it every year. Why watch that when we could watch Jim Carrey's Grinch? I'm sure I often thought. Now, though, as a 23 year old, I get it (I have for the past few years but just now making the post). The older I get, the more I appreciate more of the movie.   This year was the first year I really thought about how sweet it is that Alfie's dad bought him the bb gun. The joy and excitement on the dads face when Alfie is going to the present looks so real. All movie, everyone told Alfie he didn't need the gun and that he'd shoot his eye out, but that didn't stop the dad. He wanted to see his kid's face light up on Christmas.   The movie is FULL of memorable and quotable moments. Between You'll shoot your eye out, Fra-gee-lay, and fa ra Ra Ra Ra you'll surely get some laughter or feels out of it. I've even gotten to where I appreciate the narration style storytelling.   The movie is just chock full of Christmas good time moments and is truly a Christmas classic.

It wasn't really groundbreaking in terms of visuals for its time, but what captivated me the most about this movie was how beautifully the plot unveiled as an emotional rollercoaster. You've got Roger with his Pongo who meets and later marries Anita who's got her Perdita, then Pongo and Perdita themselves form a love union. Then you have the antagonist Cruella, who by the way is so explicitly well portrayed, who's the polar opposite of the protagonists, that creates this incredible good vs. evil story. The comedy, the funny dialogue, the soundtrack, and of course the voices are some other reasons why I like this version of the movie the best.      To preface, I've seen the live action movie from 1996 and quite frankly it didn't capture the same vibes as the original. I could be biased, but it seemed more watered down, almost as if Disney were forcing it to be more children appealing. Idk, do you agree? If no, why?",

The deaths are outstanding and the twist ending I thought was very well done. I do think the direction lagged a bit.

Huston with The Maltese Falcon, Welles with Citizen Kane, Lumet with 12 Angry Men, and Darabont with The Shawshank Redemption gave us instant classics still considered some of the best movies ever made.   My pick though,  is Rob Reiner, for This is Spinal Tap. A hilarious mockumentary that reinvigorated the style. Yet, even as a spoof it does well to show the behind the scenes of a Rock and Roll band and their antics. Endlessly quotable,  it remains one of the best comedies ever created and an absolute classic.

But I was wondering whether the theme of not understanding or even misunderstanding each other (portrayed through the language barrier) also played a role in this. Just think of the scene with the cat, where Jang (or rather the transcription of his recording) misinterpreted 'heart' as 'head'. Could it be that the Korean voice message, especially the passage Song keeps skipping to, has also a similarity to something that expresses love in Chinese? If not literally, then maybe allegorically or regarding the imagery? For me, this topic of misunderstanding / the troubles of communication are so omnipresent in this movie that I was sure it had to be in this scene somewhere, too, but sadly I neither speak Korean nor Chinese, so I can't really look at the text itself.",

I'm a huge Nolan fan, but the dude seems to think everyone attempted a PhD in physics and fully understands the concept of time. I'm not bashing either both are amazing just felt it was interesting the duality of two successful filmmakers.  Edit: I should've worded this better and not like it's a fact and exactly how their filmmaking and philosophy is. I mainly wanted to see what the users here thought of it and discussion around it. I watch a lot of movies but will not pretend to understand many, if any, of the different factors they are considering in the process of creation. Also my favorite movies from both of them are Memento and Aliens.  Edit2: I'm also not trying to imply that fans of James are inherently dumber or Nolan fans are pseudo-intellectuals.  Edit3: I've read a lot of these and they've swayed my opinion on this a lot. I initially hadn't considered just how much Nolan spends on explaining the concepts as him treating the audience as stupid and I agree that would go against my initial post. I was originally considering the fact that he does use concepts that need such long explanations to flesh out as him overestimating the audiences intelligence to follow his lead, which could just be chalked up to a flaw in his writing. And to clarify I know Cameron doesn't shy away from complex themes either like colonialism and environmentalism it's just in my mind more accessible for people to understand than the references Nolan is going for that have to be outright taught - Cameron doesn't have to be as heavy handed with explanations and the movie is still enjoyable and digestible if you don't understand something or miss it.   Seems the main thing people here have been able to agree on is instead Nolan overestimates his own intelligence.

I have yet to see a funnier Christmas film than Bad Santa. Billy Bob Thornton, Tony Cox and Bernie Mac were superb in this film and so was Terry Zwigoff, the director. I think the kid was very good as well but the true Superstar of the film was John Ritter who has never funnier than in this film and I don't say it lightly. John Ritter is so good that I started laughing even when appeared on the screen after first 2 scenes.

Here are my thoughts.  Early in the film her father says he told Trunchbull to give her harsher punishment. understandably most parents would not allow this but a parent saying she can go extra harsh, means she can go extra brutal.  Throughout the film she doesnt develop her powers until after her encounter with the Trunchbull. (Where she is exploding bombs or mines.)  We know that Matilda loves reading and is very creative in her stories.  There is a lasting memory of Bruce trying to move a can with his mind, we know that Matilda uses her experiences in her story that she tells to the librarian.  When we see her in the clouds she talks about people not being able to reach her and I think there was something else.  Throughout the film we see bits that state something like it's not always a happy ending.  Metaphorically, the chains that bind Trunchbull at the end are the police, but she somehow gets away, maybe saying she evaded the law?  The chokey resembles a coffin in the middle of nowhere that Matilda breaks like she is fighting death? At the end she reveals plenty more like she had a plan to kill all of the children, but Matilda's story shows how she stops her and destroys them all, like the consequence of her death mesnt she went too far this time and there was an investigstion.  At the end of the film she releases the glue from her fathers hst, like she has finally let go.  I think there were a few more things but i cant for the life of me remember. Its released tomorrow on Netflix so if you give it a watch again let me know what you think.  All in all I loved the film and I think if this theory was intentional, its a masteroiece if story-telling.  My daughter can't wait to watch it again tomorrow.

Probably because he was the one who revolutionized the cinema history by founding the genre 'space opera' together with George Lucas. However, there are musicians who made exceptional jobs like howard shore or hans zimmer(this one is probably the closest to the geniality of willians) that for some people are more remarkable than willians.

Personally I like to think that Jess somehow survived or wasn't attacked by Billy - it could be the way the last scene is edited but it seems like there's way too little time between Billy's descent from the attic and his phone call for him to kill Jess and get to the phone. Also, it's pretty well established that Billy is severely mentally unstable, but it seems odd even for him that he'd call the house after killing Jess knowing it was empty and that no one would pick up, except for maybe the policeman outside?  I think its because the film wants us to sympathize with Jess that I want her to survive, but I still can't make up my mind as to what happens. So what do you think - does Jess survive or is she ultimately another one of Billy's victims? Would love to hear your thoughts about the ending as well as some of the films other ambiguities!

        "body": "I am one of those people who is always looking for the most disturbing, unsettling movie out there. Before today, I felt like I had seen all the “disturbing” movies people usually suggest on Reddit threads. Just Melvin Just Evil, Dear Zachary, A Serbian Film, Oldboy, etc. the list goes on and on. While I understood why all those movies were considered disturbing in their own ways, none of them really ever gave me that sense of “wtf” that you feel deep in your gut when something really disturbing genuinely effects you.   Well, let me tell you, that all changed today when I watched Threads.   It is a film depicting a nuclear apocalypse in British and the aftermaths of it and I have never seen such a disturbing film. It gave me that guy feeling. It's one of those films where, after it was over, I had to just sit in silence for like 10 minutes to just to take it all in and process it.  More importantly than it just being incredibly disturbing and effecting, is that it is GENUINELY aa fantastic movie. I feel like a lot of times when people suggest a movie they consider “disturbing,” it will be a film that relies on shock factor. I've seen a lot of disturbing movies that completely neglect storyline and artistry in lieu of just trying to make the viewer “uncomfortable.” This usually takes away from the emotional effectiveness for me.  When I say “disturbing” or “unsettling,” I mean I want a film I feel like I HAVE to sit with afterwards because it effected me so deeply. Threads is this movie for me.   So if you are like me and are looking for a movie that is not only genuinely disturbing, but also fantastically directed with a unique, enthralling storyline: watch Threads",

My point is that we always retell our Christmas movie stories, but there doesn't seem to be any ones made as of late to continue those memories. A Christmas Story Christmas could have been one, because it was a sequel to a classic. Instead, it was on Peacock.

        "body": "Casting has seen some radical changes over the years to the point where most productions actively promote the idea of ethnic diversity. In Hollywood, this should be a significant area of focus when Producers engage in new material. This is a process that happens quite seamlessly. You have a healthy balance of male and female Actors with *at least* one African American, Hispanic, Asian, Etc. It's not so much something audiences will pay notice to because these choices all feel quite natural. It needs to be stated that the preference for building a production around representation should absolutely be at the forefront of the creative process. Where that process starts to drift is when decisions are made that waver from their source material.     It's a process I've been noticing more from the minds at Disney. We look at projects like The Little Mermaid, Snow White, and now the Beauty and the Beast Anniversary. At the beginning of 2022, the Internet blew up when Rachel Zegler announced her rendition of Snow White would allow her to play a Latina Princess. The Little Mermaid made waves after it was announced Halle Bailey would play Ariel, despite making realistic sense from a regional standpoint. The Beauty and the Beast Anniversary Special recast Belle and Gaston with Black Actors while seamlessly transitioning between the animated classic and their live stage rendition.     This has brought me to Reddit to debate the idea of what demonstrates a realistic approach to casting diversity as opposed to just rebranding a role for the sake of inclusion.      It's easy to say that Disney is making creative touches to their most iconic characters for the sake of being inclusive, but that process needs to be met both ways. It's one thing to approach the idea by saying, Sure, 1937 was a very different time than 2022. What if we rebrand the essence of Snow White?. It's another to look at roles like Moana, Tiana, or Mirabel with that same logic in mind. Could Disney take a project like the Princess and the Frog and recast Tiana as a Caucasian Cook living in New Orleans? Would the Internet be just as accepting of the circumstances?      Yes, this is a sensitive subject, but the idea isn't coming from a place of stating that Hollywood shouldn't be doing these things. Characters like Aladdin, Simba, Peter Pan, Snow White, and Hercules are some of the most brilliant works of art that have ever been brought to life. Transforming those roles is by no means a bad decision, but bypassing the source material for the sole sake of political inclusivity is a monumental risk.      The idea I'll start the conversation with involves the creative process. An iconic showpiece isn't determined by profit, but by the amount of thought, love, and attention to detail that goes into storytelling and character development. Creating something original can be just as meaningful for generations to come, while still paying respect to the source material.",

A movie like Fight Club criticizes Toxic-Masculine culture but it's message is easily missed because the film does bring up legitimate issues that men (and women) still face today such as what it's like to live in a society under Late Stage Capitalism. While your not meant to agree with the points Tyler spouts, I feel it would have been a little more powerful if the film gave the Narrator an alternative path that he could have gone, but I understand that was not the point.  I saw a post here recently on movies who's subtlety messages are either ignore or not considered by audiences, like Robocop's pro Union and Anti-Capitalist message or It's a Wonderful Life's Socialist message and It made me remember how hard trying to convey a message that people will understand without being as transparent and in your face about it. Doing that would have the film be branded as propaganda by some. I always support film-makers not holding back in their messages but I know many would disagree with me.   How can a filmmaker convey a message in their movies without being accused of making propaganda?  I know many go to films for escape but films (and media in general) believe it or not has been a huge influence in how we progressed as a society so I understand why filmmakers always have a message they to put out there that could spark change.",

        "body": "Mild spoilers for All quiet on the western front, if you haven't seen I highly recommend it, it's visuals and acting is top-notch and it's probably one of my favorite war or anti-war movies I've seen in a while. But it is not perfect and I feel it loses some of the best bits from it's source material.  I don't want to sound too condescending but most people do not understand what truly makes a film anti-war. I personally don't even always understand, or even often understand. That said, I'm tired of seeing every new war movie get labeled as anti-war basically immediately- because it is horrific and harrowing.  Anti-war is not the same thing as “War bad,” everyone knows war is bad, but yet it still happens every day. A True anti-war film IMO gets to the heart of the human condition to discuss and deconstruct what makes us tick, what makes us violent, whether violence is inevitable, etc. As a filmmaker though, you really can't just say war is bad, it's like saying rape is bad and acting all smug and smart about it (cough cough Irreversible cough cough).  Anyways, All Quiet (2022) is a fine movie but a failure as an anti-war piece, and IMO big letdown to the source material.  What are some movies you feel truly convey an Anti-War narrative, not just War is Bad.",

Scary Movie 2 while not as good as 1 imo was a close second. The parody on the exorcist and that opening scene was fucking gold. David Cross was a hilarious addition to the franchise. “I'm still handicapped?

The entire final act's drama could've been avoided ENTIRELY if Betty had literally just said what was bothering her when she confronted Bob at the piano. Then Bob could've said Nope. None of that's true. and moved right on. Instead, she refuses to discuss literally anything with him, cold-shouldering him not once but twice before she finally realizes what was overheard was taken out of context entirely.   Also, it's a good example of minding your own business. If Emma was immediately called out for her eavesdropping instead of people just thinking it's harmless literally NOTHING bad would've happened in the entire movie. In a way, the entire drama of the final act is her fault, completely.   Thank you for coming to my rant. Enjoy your holidays, everyone!",

        "body": " Having already spoken about my most OVERRATED films of all time (just in my personal opinion of course, don't hate me), I thought it'd be fun to mention movies I never thought got enough praise or attention. On a side note, these are things I personally think are underrated. Maybe you don't like these movies or think that they're not underrated. That's fine, these are just my opinions, and I'm more than open to your opinions too.  * **Megamind -** Full-on masterpiece IMO. All the jokes land, the romance is really well done, it has creative action scenes and has some really deep character development.  &#x200B;  * **Meet the Robinsons -** Such a great movie with a heartfelt message and endearing and hilarious characters. What's not to love? Also, the Bowler Hat Guy is just the best character ever. I love him so much.  &#x200B;  * **9 -** Basically Tim Burton meets Terminator. AKA really awesome. Love the visuals, the voice acting is great, and the atmosphere is really well done. Wish this got more attention when it came out.  &#x200B;  * **Chappie -** The rappers can be irritating but I thought Yolandi was alright. Concept was both hilarious and sympathetic to me as well. Always loved the Joburg setting too (even if it was done better in District 9).  &#x200B;  * **Elysium -** Great cast, cool concept and lots of fun action scenes. The romance is a bit forced at times and Jodie Foster could've been a much better villain, but it's still worth a look for sure.  &#x200B;  * **Prometheus -** If you can get over the lack of xenomorphs, it's actually a great film IMO. The acting is top notch, Noomi Rapace is a great replacement for Sigourney Weaver, and the Engineers are really interesting. Why did Covenant have to squander all of this movie's potential? Ugh.  &#x200B;  * **Chocolat -** Everyone gives this movie their all, ESPECIALLY Alfred Molina. Very beautiful film. Johnny Depp is the only one the sticks out as miscast, but even then, he's still endearing and likeable in this.  &#x200B;  * **Charlie and the Chocolate Factory -** Johnny Depp isn't as good as Gene Wilder IMO, but he's entertaining, and this is MUCH more faithful to the book. The visuals are better, the songs are great, and Christopher Lee is honestly kind of underrated here.  &#x200B;  * **Arthur Christmas -** Luckily this is developing a cult following. Possibly the best Christmas movie of the 2010's entirely. The animation is crisp, its message is REALLY endearing, and the comedy always lands.  &#x200B;  * **Antz -** Sure it's a rip-off of a Bug's Life and has both a pretty nothing romance and problematic lead actor, but it's still a well animated movie (the bugs are actually the right sizes unlike in a Bugs Life), and the message of standing out from the crowd is still well-realized. Plus, just look at that voice cast.  &#x200B;  * **A Knight's Tale -** It's a lot like Shrek as far as tone, but it definitely has its own unique feel. Paul Bettany and Alan Tudyk are really funny, and Heath Ledger is great as he always was. Don't listen to the critics, this movie is really entertaining.  &#x200B;  * **Walk the Line -** A biopic before those became overdone, Joaquin Phoenix is SO damn good as Johnny Cash here. Everyone gives great performances, and I wish this movie got talked about more.  &#x200B;  * **Super 8 -** Sure it borrows a lot from E.T (although so does Stranger Things if we're being honest), this movie tells a mostly unique story, and feels like a love letter to making home made movies with your friends. It also has its own unique alien with a great sense of mystery to it all. Highly recommended.  &#x200B;  * **Tron: Legacy -** This might be biased since I grew up with this movie, but I don't get the hate at all. The story is great, the visuals are out of this world, the soundtrack is INSANE, and there's never a dull moment. Why is this movie hated again?  &#x200B;  * **Atlantis: The Lost Empire -** The visuals are stellar from Disney once again, the characters are all distinct and memorable, and the culture of Atlantis is so interesting in this one. PLEASE make a live action remake of this instead of another Renaissance movie.  &#x200B;  * **The Emperor's New Groove -** Kuzco is definitely a divisive lead, but I like his story since he's so resistant to change. It makes you want to see him improve even more. Plus, Kronk might be the funniest Disney character ever IMO.  &#x200B;  * **Tomb Raider 2018 -** Sure, it's a lot like the game, but the game is great, so I don't blame them for going that route. As far as the complaints about her boobs being too small, grow the fuck up. Seriously. Alicia Vikander is a great fit for this role, and I look forward to the sequel. MUCH better than the Angelina Jolie ones.  &#x200B;  * **Night at the Museum -** Ben Stiller is admittedly a little tame in this one, but considering the characters and animals that surround him, it's probably for the best. Robin Williams is really good as Teddy Roosevelt. REALLY wish he could've played him in a biopic (same for Amy Adams as Amelia Earhart in the sequel)  &#x200B;  * **National Treasure 1 and 2 -** The clues the characters find amongst national monuments would be enough of a sell for me (being a big Assassin's Creed fan), but then you add in the memorable characters, and you have a pair of really entertaining movies. Bring on movie 3 please.  &#x200B;  * **Nightcrawler -** Infamously snubbed at the Oscars, this movie is a true masterpiece of a film. I honestly don't think Jake Gyllenhaal has ever been better than he was here. MUST WATCH.  &#x200B;  * **Thor 2011 -** The stuff on Earth isn't always that exciting and the romance could've used some retooling, but man Chris Hemsworth, Tom Hiddleston and Anthony Hopkins are all on top form here. ESPECIALLY Hiddleston. This movie never gets the appreciation it deserves IMO. I'd take this over the trash that is Love and Thunder any day.  &#x200B;  * **Kubo and the Two Strings -** SOOOOO well animated and voice acted. This movie is a visual and mental feast and is never once anything but engaging to me. This movie could've won best animated feature, and I would've been okay with it honestly.  &#x200B;  * **Hotel Transylvania 1 -** It treads familiar ground and is predictable at times, but its homages to classic characters and zany visual style are out of this world. Not a single actor feels miscast either, despite Adam Sandler being Dracula.  &#x200B;  * **Clue -** One of the few boardgames that could actually be turned into a movie without feeling like a cash grab, Clue manages to bring together a bunch of fantastic comedic actors for a movie that I'm never not in the mood for. It manages to be quirky and goofy for the kids, but also sexual and even political for the adults. This movie never got the attention it deserved IMO.  &#x200B;  * **Game Night -** This reminds me a lot of Clue, except way more gruesome and more subversive. Jesse Plemons is so damn funny in this one, and the movie is never boring for even a minute. I really wish I could've seen this in the theater.  &#x200B;  * **Zathura -** Another movie about games, Zathura is technically a Jumanji movie, but manages to be a great time all on its own. The kids bickering is really entertaining, the world building is surprisingly well-handled, and it's just impossible to have a bad time watching it.  &#x200B;  * **Revenge of the Sith -** I actually like the prequels for the most part, but I get why people don't. But this movie is actually good IMO. Hayden is much better as Anakin here than in the second movie, Obi-Wan is great, Grievous is a cool new character, and Order 66 will never not be tragic. That's to say nothing of the EPIC score and final duel.  &#x200B;  * **Halloween H20: 20 Years Later -** Jamie Lee Curtis is really good in this movie and the new setting of the private school in California, provides a fresh take on this franchise. If this had been the last Halloween movie, I honestly would've been okay with that.  &#x200B;  * **On Her Majesty's Secret Service -** George Lazenby was screwed over. He might not have been the best 007, but he was good enough to get a sequel. That ending scene always gets me, and Blofeld is really well done in this film for me. Such a shame Diamonds are Forever sucked so hard.  &#x200B;  * **Enemy of the State -** Will Smith and Gene Hackman in a movie about government intrusion? How can anyone not like this? There's never a dull moment to be found, and its endlessly gripping IMO. Plus, there's the theory about this being a sequel to the Conversation, which would be pretty cool ngl.  &#x200B;  * **Push -** It's basically an X-Men movie, but it takes place in Hong Kong and has Chris Evans, Dakota Fanning and Djimon Hounsou in it. Really cool score, awesome set pieces and interesting mythology combine, to give us a truly overlooked superhero movie.  &#x200B;  * **Bad Moms -** Coming from a single parent home where my mom had to take care of me and my older brother, I can say that this movie gets a lot right about the struggles of being a mom. The comedy is hit-or-miss, but I love what it has to say about the burdens of parenting and the need to loosen up.  &#x200B;  * **Return to Oz -** This movie is the only one that actually feels like the books. The Oz books are weird and creepy and awesome. As much as I love the original movie, I really love this one too. Honestly, I would pay for Disney to bring back Fairuza Balk and do a sequel to this.  &#x200B;  * **A Goofy Movie -** The romance is so damn realistic, the father/son struggles are well-balanced with the comedy, and the soundtrack is a banger. The emotional moments always land for me, and the movie never fails to pull at my heartstrings. Watching this after Once Upon a Christmas makes it even more fulfilling honestly. DON'T watch the sequel though, unless you want to be disappointed.  &#x200B;  * **Bumblebee -** The only reason this movie failed, was because of the Michael Bay movies driving away the fan interest. This movie on the other hand, is much better than the first five, benefitting from a more likeable protagonist, more memorable side characters, and having a fun dynamic between our leads.  &#x200B;  * **The Bee Movie -** This is definitely a flawed movie, but people make it out like it's the worst film ever. Honestly, I think this movie gets its message across well, has good animation, and a likeable lead. I also love how the bees win their case, but the world suffers because of it. That's really cool IMO. As far as the romance goes, he's clearly into the human woman, but she's not into him. It's obviously one-sided IMO. He helped her realize she was better off without her ex-boyfriend and that's all. If you can get over that, this movie is low-key not that bad.  &#x200B;  * **Rise of the Guardians -** This movie is REALLY good honestly. None of the characters are forgettable, the lore is endlessly fascinating, Pitch is a scary villain, Jack is a very endearing character, and this movie plays well during pretty much any part of the year. With a catchier title and better marketing, this could've been the franchise-starter that it deserved to be.  &#x200B;  * **Mischief -** This is the much raunchier and more realistic version of Grease in some ways IMO. The characters are flawed but likeable, the setting is unique for this kind of story and the soundtrack is a bop. Plus, I love the way they subvert your expectations with who Jonathan is going to get with at the end.  &#x200B;  * **Some Kind of Wonderful -** I love this movie so much more than Pretty in Pink (of which this is a remake). The main romance between artist Keith and tomboy Watts, is really well-handled, with Mary Stuart-Masterson KILLING her performance in this. Highly underrated IMO.  &#x200B;  * **The Great Mouse Detective -** The humor is great; the villain is genuinely scary, and the animation is of course excellent. Nothing bad to say about this honestly, just go watch it.  &#x200B;  * **Young Sherlock Holmes -** Speaking of Sherlock, THIS is his most underrated adaptation by far. The characters are all likeable, Holmes isn't made to be too perfect, Watson is a fun comedic relief, and Eh-Tar/Moriarty is a genuinely interesting character. This absolutely should've been a franchise. What a travesty.  &#x200B;  * **Chef -** This movie makes food look better than any other movie I've seen honestly. Jon Favreau gives a really underrated performance, the setting is unique and the story of an estranged father and son rediscovering their bond is so gratifying to watch (especially since I've struggled with my father in the past).  &#x200B;  * **While You Were Sleeping -** It has a lot of cliches in it for sure but seeing Sandra Bullock managing to find a family for herself and not being alone on Christmas, is just really satisfying to see. The comedy is really good for the most part too. The main romance is a little hit-or-miss, but I still enjoy this one.  &#x200B;  * **Treasure Planet -** The visuals and world-building speak for themselves honestly. This movie is just STUNNING and manages to inject a lot of life in a familiar tale. Long John Silver is really entertaining in this movie too honestly. Not all the characters work for me and the plot is predictable, but it still gets a LOT of things right, and should also get a live action remake pronto.  &#x200B;  * **Pleasantville -** The way this movie utilizes black and white against color, is REALLY clever honestly. Both Tobey Maguire and Reese Witherspoon are engaging characters who you enjoy seeing progress in this TV world. The romance is great, the commentary on classism and racism is well-played, and the way this recaptures those classic sitcoms so well, makes me wonder if Wandavision ripped it off at all. Great film all around!  &#x200B;  * **Stranger Than Fiction -** This movie manages to be heartfelt, romantic and comedic all at the same time. Will Ferrell is on top form here, and the concept of this movie is utilized brilliantly. Seeing a man determined to not only survive, but live his previously mundane life to the fullest, is really relatable to me.  &#x200B;  * **Better Off Dead -** John Cusack hates this movie, but don't listen to him. Sure, it can be a little nuts at times, but that's all part of the charm. Seeing Cusack realize his growing feelings for Monique through fixing up a car together is just really sweet, and the running gag about the bike messenger wanting his two bucks always cracks me up. Also, it's so satisfying to watch Dan Schneider get beat up at the end.  &#x200B;  * **Holes -** This movie captures the spirit of the book perfectly. It tells a great story involving a lot of adult themes (including racism), and yet is still viewable by families. I wish more people knew about this one.  I'm sure there's a lot more that I'm forgetting about, but these movies are all worth another look IMO.",

        "body": "I just turned 30 and some of the feelings he has are feelings I've had as an adult in a serious relationship. You feel portions of your youth slipping away and it's to come to grips with that when your significant other is so hell-bent on moving so fast to the point where you're having a hard time keeping up. I think the brilliant thing Diablo Cody and Reitman do with the couple is that they flesh out the two characters very well. In the beginning, Garner's character seems controlling and bossy and Bateman's character seems to be the fun, aloof one of the two.  But as the movie goes on and Bateman's relationship with Juno grows he starts realizing that he's not yet ready to let go of his dreams. I think in the end there's no true villain here and it's the classic case of two people who probably should've never been married getting married. Bateman's character is an asshole because he left his wife right when she was getting her dream of having a baby, but Garner's character kept downing his dreams and interests and completely blocked out what made him happy. I think that storyline by itself is 20 times more interesting than the Juno story they're trying to tell.",

Also the last good adaptation I remember (if it got any else) was the one from 1935  And I guess isolating this superhero film from the MCU, it'd be really cool to see an adaptation of Captain America's civil war from the comics cause that one had what felt like an army of heroes on both sides.

        "title": "I feel like 'Howl's Moving Castle's is an incomplete story",
        "body": "(Beware: Not a Spoiler Free Post and Got a Bit Carried Away)  Which is unfortunate for me, since I liked most other aspects of the movie. The art and music were simply fantastic. I loved the world it took place in, alongside with how the story handled the war. Really liked the characters too. With all this stuff to love about this film, it's just sad to me that the plot felt... Unsatisfactory?  Not unsatisfactory in the sense of the plot meandering around, I actually like that type of story telling now and then. Makes the story feel more organic. No, to me, it's more like there was a lot of missed potential in terms of character arcs and themes. *This, to me, largely comes about in the last half of the movie.*  What I mean by missed potential is as in elaboration and expansion, not as in drastic change. Some of these characters, to me, were somewhat robbed of some depth. *And in some ways, I feel like all these characters needed were some small scenes or pieces of dialogue.*  Such as the witch and Howl.   The witch played a major role in the first part of the movie but shifts completely in personality and in terms of relationships halfway through. There was little in the way of transition or integration until she was fighting over the heart. It's a shame because a more in depth look into her reconciling with herself, with Sophie, and with Howl would've been fascinating. An otherwise evil person falling to rock bottom who finds a way to address her past and her past self. Sure there'd be some bumps, like fighting over Howl's heart but she learns to let go - just like in the movie, but with more weight.  Howl, to me, was the core of the movie. The characters gravitated to him and affected him. He and his arc very much seemed to be the emotional focus of the movie. I just wished that some more focus was made to that. If his relationships between certain characters, like Sophie and the witch, were expanded upon I'd feel this movie would be more complete. His character roughly changes as his bond with Sophie grows, but the development of that relationship seems lack luster to me.   Additionally, with the witch suddenly living in his castle it would've been interesting if she, a living embodiment of the past and personality that's been holding him back, interacted with him more. It also would've been more interesting if Howl was slightly more similar to her in terms of personality. It'd serve as a nice literary mirror and could help better characterize Howl before Sophie meets him in the castle - it'd better set up the stage for his character growth.  *The Witch*  The witch is a spooky, powerful gal who curses Sophie, setting the story to motion and instantly becoming one of the 'primary' antagonists ( at least for a good part of the movie). The dynamic, in the form of conversation (between Sophie and the other characters) or interactions between her and Sophie, that follows suit is nice. Her losing her powers was satisfying and interesting. But her personality pretty much switches instantaneously afterwards alongside Sophie's interaction with her. It feels as though there should've been something (or somethings) that serves as transitions for these two changes.  For a witch who was accustomed to being powerful and youthful suddenly losing her powers and having her body revert to its proper age, a change like that isn't something to be shrugged off at. Yet, beyond being exhausted immediately afterwards, the witch doesn't have much of a reaction to a drastic life/identity change. No grief, no processing, no progress towards coming to terms. It's just weird how the film jumps to her being fine and zen.  As for the relationship between Sophie and the witch, there should've been something after the escape where they reconciled or built some basic respect/understanding. Sophie was yelling at her for being unable/unwilling to reverse her curse not long before the witch lost her powers. Sophie was even spitefully competitive when going up the stairs. As much as Sophie is a kind and understanding person, there should've been a scene where she could demonstrate that (beyond being silent). There should've been something that would've addressed the conflict that centers around one of the primary issues that the characters are trying to address in the movie.  It's also a shame that there wasn't more interaction between the witch and Howl. They were lovers, then things fell apart because of Howl. Howl's left as someone who wants to sidestep the topic altogether. The witch wants to get to him, out of a combination of love and spite. Once again, she even fights over Howl's heart. So it's just weird that there is little in terms of interaction between them once they meet again. It would've been a perfect opportunity to lay the groundwork for the witch letting Howl go for instance.  *Howl*  I feel like Howl was a little bit all over the place.  Howl was another point of conflict in the movie, in the sense that the movie largely revolved around him getting his 'heart' back. It's how the movie ended, it's what the climax was on, it's a defining part of his identity and relationships. The 'heart' matters, physically and emotionally. Without his physical heart, Howl is missing part of his humanity. Everytime he uses magic, he physically transforms into something less human. When he fights, he loses some of his 'heart' and humanity in the form of transformation, same for the wizards he fights. But emotionally speaking, he is also somewhat 'heartless'. He's described as someone who's self absorbed and prideful. He, at parts of the movie, is emotionally unstable.   However, why is he emotionally heartless? Besides missing his physical heart. *He's heartless because he's not 'whole'*. And Sophie becomes that person who makes him whole, who gives him back his heart.   Everything, I mentioned about Howl above is blatantly in the movie but there is little that helps develops his relationship with Sophie into something romantic. Rather it jumps about rather inorganically.  And although the movie does a great job displaying his lack of humanity through an outburst and transformations, little is shown emotionally on just how he lacks humanity besides us being told that by characters.  *But yeah...*  Long story short, I think Howl's Moving Castle would've been an even better movie if it added some small additions via dialogue and scenes that would've made the plot even more character driven.   I think that, given how Sophie is intended to be a relatively static character who serves as a cause or catalyst of change for those around her (ala Belle from Beauty and the Beast), characters like Howl and the witch should be expanded upon. I think it'd have the potential at better supporting the ideas and themes within the movie in a less haphazard and a more satisfactory and smooth way.",

It's about revealing a character's motivations and abilities in a single introductory scene. Tell us how they are gonna be in the movie.  my example  would be. How Scar is introduced playing with a helpless mouse he is about to devour while skipping out on his nephew's birth ceremony. When Zazu reprimands Scar (causing him to lose the mouse) he immediately tries to eat Zazu. Already, we know that this guy is Bad News.  Or Aladdin shows himself to not only be an affable thief, but a guy who's soft enough to give his stolen food away to a pair of homeless children without a second thought. The One Jump Ahead song tells you absolutely everything you need to know about the guy in a catchy two-minute package. The later reprise after giving away the bread also reveals his more vulnerable side and that being called a street rat really does bother him, and this insecurity eventually leads to further conflict in the movie.",

        "title": "Cloverfield: A Look Back, 15 Years Later",
        "body": "You would expect an article like this to start out by saying something like, “it's hard to believe it's been fifteen years since…” and that's exactly how we are going to begin. It absolutely IS hard to believe that Clover first started wrecking New York City fifteen years ago. When Cloverfield was released on January 18th, 2008, found-footage style horror movies were very much a thing but somehow it came in feeling fresh and different. It took time to build up the characters and let us know who these people were before it threw in the curveball of that first explosion that caught us all off guard.  Cloverfield was the brainchild of J.J. Abrams (Lost, Alias) who wanted nothing more than to make a monster movie. He started coming up with ideas in 2007 and eventually brought on Neville Page to complete the actual design of Clover. The project was given the go-ahead and Drew Goddard (The Cabin in the Woods, Bad Times at the El Royale) was tasked with writing, while Matt Reeves (Let Me In, The Batman) would be behind the camera. Everything was coming up clovers.  Surprise Parties are Scary!  The movie starts out calmly enough, showing us what must have been a beautiful day between our main hero, Rob (played by Michael Stahl David) and Beth (Odette Annable) as they visit Coney Island and generally have a pleasant time together. It's kind of a shame that no one thought to switch out the tape because the events of the film are basically being recorded over what was probably the last good day either of them had.  We arrive at the surprise party via some clever editing (that made it look like home movies my dad recorded over with Monday Night Football) to find Rob's brother, Jason (Mike Vogal), attempting to pawn the job of party documenter off to Hud (played by T.J. Miller). Jason is successful and Hud makes an absolutely awful, yet entertaining, go of it, somehow finding time to actually do what he was tasked with while simultaneously, hilariously, striking out with Marlena (Lizzy Caplan). Quickly we find out that the rest of the friend group was unaware of Rob and Beth's budding, now soured, romance because Lily (Jessica Lucas) is really bad at keeping secrets. During Rob, Jason, and Hud's attempted heart-to-heart, the film decided it was time to put its foot on the gas and things start going south quickly.  What Cloverfield Got Right  The moment I watched the head of the Statue of Liberty go sliding down the street while New Yorkers were running and screaming in every direction I knew I was in for a good time. It didn't matter much to me what happened after that, I was watching a monster-horror, disaster movie filmed by slightly intoxicated twenty-somethings. It had me hooked. Luckily, I'm happy to report, that I didn't have to sit through an effects-heavy monster flick with little to no plot, Cloverfield actually had a story.  Looking back with nearly fifteen years to reflect, it can be said that Cloverfield got quite a few things right. The first thing that stood out to me was the story, it was what a rom-com would be if a rom-com was set during an interdimensional monster attack. Man likes girl, man and girl have an amazing time, man thinks he can't be with a girl because man is leaving town, girl gets new man, man tries to (and does) win back girl. That old formula set during the possible end of their lives is a nice touch for what could have been just another monster movie.  The pace is another thing the movie got completely right, with a runtime of only 84 minutes they didn't leave a lot of time for fluff and with the found-footage angle, all the fluff got left between presses of the record button. The movie had really fun scares that built on the terror of a city under siege from a giant monster and the walking, biting, skin flakes that kept falling off of her (Clover is a girl monster and she's absolutely adorable, you'll never convince me otherwise). Speaking of Clover, that's another thing the film got right. We saw just enough of the monster that we knew what she looked like but for the longest time, they let us fill in the blanks which are often far more frightening.  What Cloverfield Got Wrong  The short answer, as far as I'm concerned is, not a lot. There are plenty of people who bring up the shaky camera and how it legitimately made some people nauseous but I never found it a problem, I thought it was part of the appeal. I will be the first to admit that a few small plot holes do exist, the biggest two involving the camera itself. No battery would last that long and you know they didn't have extras. Also… how did it survive if the military did what they said they were going to do? I can overlook those though, they're big to some, but they didn't hinder my ability to enjoy the movie.  Conclusion  J.J. Abrams, Matt Reeves and company took what could have been a very straightforward monster movie with little to offer (other than eye candy) and delivered TONS of eye candy, explosions, and tense drama while also layering in heart and an actually appealing story. I loved Cloverfield when I first watched it in the theater all those years ago and re-watching it recently did little to change my mind. It has spawned two in-universe sequels, 2016's 10 Cloverfield Lane, and 2018's The Cloverfield Paradox, with a reported direct sequel to the original film currently in development. Cloverfield is a hell of a good way to burn roughly 90 minutes and if you haven't seen it yet (well, buddy, it's been 15 years), I really can't recommend it highly enough. If you like horror or monsters or just watching things go boom, this one is for you.",

I love Christmas movies so I'll name some that are family favorites in my house.   Scrooge (1970) - this is a classic version of A Christmas Carol with original songs. This production benefits from lots of talent carried over from 1968's Oliver! Another classic musical. Not much to say about this one other than it's my family's classic version of A Christmas Carol, it's paint by the numbers, but has good acting and some fun songs.   Arthur Christmas - I have no idea how many people remember this extremely cute movie from 2011 but I adore it. It has trappings of a classic kids Christmas movie where you might expect an evil real estate man trying to destroy Christmas, but no! Nothing like that. In fact I don't know if you could find a Christmas movie where the stakes are lower! In the first 15 minutes of the movie Christmas goes off without a hitch, all the presents delivered, Santa's job is done! Only wait, one child was missed. Just one. What follows is a truly deep dive in my opinion about how the biggest enemy of Christmas isn't an evil cartoon villain, it's forgetting that Christmas isn't about your petty arguments or the glory of who gets to be Santa, or what methods are best, it's about the joy the person you give a gift has.  It's a subtle reminder not to make the holidays about yourself, make it about those you care about.   Klaus 2019 - on Netflix, a surprisingly good and as far as I know completely original new origin for Santa. It got lots of awards, you very well have heard of it, but if you haven't, definitely give it a try.   Spirited 2022 - I doubt this is a hidden gem, but it's new, and I've already watched it 4 times this year lol. Ryan Reynolds and Will Ferrell star in yet another Christmas Carol adaptation, also a musical, with a few really awesome numbers that involve huge casts of dancers. Even if you're tired of A Christmas Carole, I highly recommend checking this one out as it will surprise you a bit here and there as the ghosts find this Christmas goes off the rails a bit. It's on Apple + only I think.   What's your holiday recommendations? Have you seen any of mine?",

The plot is also fascinating: Keanu playing a lawyer who knows his clients are guilty, and yet defending them anyways, unaware of the impending consequences of his actions.   It all leads up to the final showdown of Kevin Lomax and John Milton, and man is it spectacular; Pacino goes more Pacino than any of his other roles. But it loses me towards the end, when Lomax kills himself in the altar(?) which leads to the end of Milton and his half-sister too. Except, it was a different reality all along, as the film foreshadows in the beginning. So Lomax, who arguably is more evil than Milton, gets a second chance. He doesn't have to live with the terrible things he did.  It just wasn't a satisfying ending to me. Here's my alternate ending: Lomax is offered the choice by Milton to inherit the legal empire in exchange for giving him children. Still grieving over Mary Ann's suicide and the reporter's revelation before he was ran over, he decides to go back to Gainesville with his mother and become a good lawyer. Not a happy ending because of his consequences, but he still finds some redemption.   If it weren't for the ending we got, I think The Devil's Advocate could have become a cult classic, even a critically acclaimed film.",

I'm sure many of you think I must be crazy or have terrible taste in movies, but let me tell you some of the reasons I love this movie.   I'm a bigger fan of the Resident Evil movie franchise than the game series, having only played a few titles. So I am not bothered by characters not being portrayed like they are in the games, but I'm familiar enough to recognize character names.   This RE entry is directed by Paul W.S. Anderson, his return to the franchise, having directed the 1st but not the 2nd & 3rd. The movie was filmed using 3D cameras, not converted to 3D in post, making for an enjoyable experience for 3D fans. FYI, if you have an Oculus Quest 2, this can be watched in 3D via Vudu.   First, excellent opening sequence with a great soundtrack. Followed by the assault on the Umbrella Tokyo facility by multiple Alices, which is something I just love. The image of over a dozen black clad Alices running around with sub machine guns is one of the best in the series. Great action, especially in 3D, with a very cool depiction of Wesker introduced who spouts ridiculous lines perfectly (“…and I want damage reports”).   The shift from Tokyo to a desolate Pacific North West, then to a zombie filled Los Angeles, provides a good balance and shift in tone. The prison is a perfect setting for a zombie apocalypse scenario.    I'm not a fan of Ali Lartner, but she is okay in this. Wentworth Miller, Kim Coates, Boris Kodjoe and (again) Shawn Roberts as Wesker are fun.  Other highlights include Alice's quarters, the Axeman shower fight, and using A Perfect Circle for the closing sequence.  This is a fun movie that I definitely recommend, especially in 3D.",

Also some scenes simply look incredibly cartoony. The battle on naboo looks terrible. All the lighting looks so unrealistic. Something CGI still struggles with today.   These were bad films when they came out and they're just as bad now. They don't continue on the star wars universe that was established in the previous trilogy.   That's my take.",

Cities, especially, can create a powerful form of this kind of saudade.  So, what film or show's portrayal of a city would you consider particularly memorable?  P.S. Please be specific. 'Gotham', for example, has been the primary setting of all the versions of Batman, but for me *The Animated Series* Gotham is the one I have the most powerful sense of being 'Gotham'. Ditto L.A. in *Collateral*. Mann's version of it feels like the most memorable portrayal of L.A. to me.",

I need to start by making it clear that Spielberg is my favorite director since I watched “Close Encounters Of The Third Kind” in 1977 at the movies when I was 13. I have watched and loved every single one of his movies and they never fail to impress me. Obviously, some are closer to my heart than others but his mastery of the craft and visual inventiveness was always there. To the point where I would always say to everyone: “There's no such thing as a bad Spielberg movie”. Now on to the subject of this posting:  “The Fabelmans” is clearly Spielberg's most personal film as its subject is his childhood, his family moving from New Jersey to Arizona and finally to California to follow his father's successful engineering career. The story is a rather bland straight forward recounting of his parents mariage difficulties and young Spielberg's nascent love of cinema and the craft of making movies. However, The Fabelmans is also Spielberg's most disappointing  movie. It is the least interesting, the least inventive and worst; his least cinematic.  And so, it is with sadness that I have now to admit that there is indeed such a thing as a bad Spielberg movie.  Even a genius moviemaker like Spielberg couldn't disprove the old adage that «Talent is a curve ».",

        "body": "Looking at film history, a lot of movies get released in 'cycles'. e.g. in the 60's you had historical epics and then westerns. Then in the 1970's you had the new wave. And in the 80s and 90s, you had a host of popular genres like thrillers, sci-fi, action, and so on. In 2000, Gladiator and LOTR enjoyed success and briefly revived the historical/fantasy epic genre.  Almost always, you have a movie or movies that cause the cycle to begin in the first place. Then you have some film(s) failing and therefore ending that genre's domination. e.g. films like Heaven's Gate and One from the Heart led to the demise of the Hollywood new wave.  Currently superhero fanchises (Marvel, DC, and so on) dominate the box office (at least in Hollywood) and seem to be doing pretty well. But at some point, there has to be a film that hypothetically fails and beings an end to this cycle.  What do you think will be the next genre to dominate the box office? And Why?  Feel free to discuss.  EDIT: Personally, I hope the historical/war movie genre will make a comeback someday, but that's probably just wishful thinking (Scott's Napoleon and the Cleopatra remake with Gal Gadot are about to be released/filmed, but whether they're actually successful is another matter).  Apart from that, it would also be great if someone made a western with a large, epic scope like Heaven's Gate (most westerns these days seem to focus on a smaller scope in general).",

He gave her full control of the editing process and she changed the films bc of it, but nobody knows that bc she was a woman. Not only that, but it is recorded that she often decided filming locations and what subjects to film. Being a female director, this is directing.  Years later, this woman would film content that would help take down Nazis in the Nuremberg trials.   Her directorial debut was actually crafted from existing footage that Vertov used for that one famous film everyone knows him for... Man with a camera I think.  Her stuff is incredibly hard to find on the internet. Does anyone share an interest in witnessing the pioneering film talent of this woman who has been erased from history and not given the credit she deserves? Do you happen to have access to her stuff, including Bukhara?  Thanks for your help.",

As for the other option, multiverse movies have a lot of potential and story telling and its honestly my favourite genre in any media.

Apparently when they did a pre-screening with Hunter he had literal flashbacks during the opening bat scene and he flipped out.  It's also just the pinnacle of iconic drug movies, maybe besides Up In Smoke. Also great to watch on drugs, the camera-work is great. It doesn't compare to the trippy modern CGI you might see in something like Dr. Strange, but they did a fantastic job for mid-90's tech.",

Later in the movie, Sam Bowden's Private Investigator mentions to Sam that if he would use the gun to kill Max Cady that he would be looking at 15 years to life in prison. In the end of the film, Sam Bowden kills Max Cady by handcuffing him to a steel railing on their houseboat, which drowns Max Cady, killing him. Afterwards we see Sam Bowden squatting on the shoreline and looking at his hands, and for a brief moment he saw blood on his hands, which ended up just being a hallucination. I believe that this is the movie's way of proving the audience that in the court's eyes, Sam Bowden will be guilty of murder and he will serve 15 years in prison, thus giving back what he took from Cady by forcing him to serve a 14 year sentence for a crime that he did commit.",

There's a few scenes of the friends talking about how exciting the war is going to be, a morale speech by their recruiters / commanders, the actual march to the battlefield, then they all die quickly, and the MC is left with himself and few others. The most emotionally stressful scenes were that of people dying, a few that the main character had little to no connection to, and from then on the film really just drags.

All relatively based on a true story about the creation of one of the most widely influential and impactful companies in history.  Now, just take a look at what has happened to Mark Zuckerberg and the company since then. This is not a political post, so I'm not sharing an opinion on these, just acknowledging they're things they've had to deal with since 2010 : their role in the Arab Spring, first billion users, Russian election interference/Cambridge Analytica, testifying before Congress, accusations of supporting propaganda involved in genocide, a trillion dollar valuation, rebranding, Metaverse, and possibly a rumored resignation. There is another compelling story about our times to be told in there somewhere.   And another Fincher/Sorkin/Eisenberg would be sure to match much of the key quality of the original. So that instead of getting ripped off the Oscar (you can like The Kings Speech all you want, you won't convince me that it's even remotely a better movie), the Academy can right this wrong. An error that I think has becoming increasingly acknowledged since then, and could also give Fincher an opportunity to finally get his due with an Oscar given his really incredible career",

Therefore, I feel obligated to turn down my volume to a socially responsible level.  But I feel like it's often at the cost of my experience of the movie/tv-series and viewing can be difficult at other times, as I'm often occupied throughout the day and evening. However, I have also found that less volume in some cases can add to the experience. Eg. a lower play volume can add suspense to a sci-fi thriller (Such as Sunshine (2007)), add meditative feelings to a mild world build, or add sinister darkness to a horror.  So the question is - What movies would you think would play well on a lower volume?It can be that they are less loud on an overall level, have a great ambient immersion without action noises (helicopters, gunshots, explosions, etc.) or music, or where the experience of the movie gets better at a lower volume in some way?  I'm discounting comedy and romance as they are not that interesting to me unless done well (like Her (2013))  Bonus points for great sound immersion/ambient immersion from the surround playback.  Many thanks!     EDIT: Many thanks for all of the comments! Before I get too many requests to go with headphones, thank you, that is noted and I will probably start to look more serious towards those :-) Maybe I should also add that I live in a fairly well-isolated apartment so my normal volume is usually not super low. Maybe 50-60-something DB on average. I just play it at cinema levels louder at other times. Again, many thanks! :-) ",

They have no idea how the characters are going to look, and they need to imagine the entire scenery.  Robin Williams as the Genie in Aladdin (1992), I think comes very close to being the GOAT next to Mel Blanc!! Not only did he manage to give the character so much energy using his voice, he also gave quite an emotional performance when it came to moments that were serious, and most of his lines were ad-libbed.  I also think James Woods as Hades in Hercules (1997) Mark Hamill as the Joker in Batman and Steve Carrell as Hammy in Over the Hedge (2006) are right behind him!",

Se7en, The Dark Knight, Chinatown, Prisoners, etc.  But we've all come across a movie, video game, comic book, etc. that just felt so needlessly dark, that it feels over-the-top or almost a parody of itself. This is what most people would call “edgy.”  What movie or movies have you guys seen that you'd best describe as edgy?  I think some noteworthy examples could be the entire Human Centipede franchise, the insanely horrible A Serbian Film, and (depending on who you ask) anything by Lars Von Trier. Anything else along those lines?  Edit: Well shit, seems like “edgy” is an insanely subjective term. Donnie Darko's been mentioned like 30 times and so have Fight Club and American Psycho. Interesting.  Edit 2: Dear God, some of you have replied quite possibly the dumbest things I've ever read on this site",

Instead I got what I can only describe as an alien's best attempt at making a Jewish movie. This movie was like someone took For Your consideration's Home for Purim seriously and tried to make it, only during channukah. I would call the movie a shonda (disgrace) but there has to be a modicum of Jewishness to earn that title.   First, almost every Jewish character was blond but more importantly they were boring af. Their complaining and nagging was endearing, not soul shattering like real Jewish grandparents. The story was about latkes but everyone knows that Hanukkah is really about jelly donuts and latkes are just an appetizer.   The kicker is that the two Jewish love interests bond over pennies that they find and pick up off the ground. It's like a Protestant from middle America was asked to write a movie about Jews and this is what he came up with.   10/10 highly recommended (a few drinks is a must)",

The acting and the story were actually pretty good too. The characters were more developed than a typical action movie and I was genuinely surprised in some of the directions the story took. Usually you can predict the plot of an action movie.   Sure there was quite a bit of cheese but that's to be expected. You can only do so much being stuck in one interior location, but I think they really got their mileage out of it (ha!) I also read they shot over COVID so they had to do it all on a sound stage which is even more impressive.   Anyone else like this film?

The conversation at the dinner table between Tess and Danny feels ripped from some old school Cary Grant shit. It's amazing. Not to mention the editing and pacing of the movie, it's more entertaining than the majority of movies I've seen the last few years.  The sequels are definitely a dip on form, they keep the cast chemistry and brilliant soundtracks but they really lose an element the first film had. I'm assuming this is because the screenwriter of 11 was not involved with the other two and the banter is definitely lacking in the sequels compared to original.  However they all have their moments and if they kept things simple, dealt with the cast members that passed away respectfully and fill the gaps they left well I would absolutely love to see another one of these movies.",

But couldn't find anything similar on his filmography. It was a TOP A/B actor. I can't remember the lead actor tho. It was definitely a top A, something like a John wick character or so.   He goes into that house and heals up. Then after 1-2 days he gets found and there's an ambush on this safe house that looks abandoned. But on the inside it's clearly fine.   The Old Guard vibes/John wick (dunno why)  It's a “recent movie”. Not older than 2010 I believe so.  Edit: I'm thankful with everyone, thank you for your replies. Unfortunately they are not the film I mention. It's quite odd because it was a good movie but I can't remember a lot. Just that scene and that specific safe house which was south of France, like 17km or so. It's a cold and dark scene, at night. Top A/B actors. I'll try to remember",

But then it barely touches on the actual premise...  And I love the main character and the side rom com feel of it all, don't get me wrong. But then it just went in a weird direction with the whole moving to Los Angeles, and the whole generic main character becomes a different person when he reaches success and fame but then redeems himself and realizes the most important things in life... That's beautiful and all but idk, it shouldn't really have gone in such a generic way imo!

I'm not the greatest writer with things like this and it's probably going to be very train of thought but here goes…  I grew up in the 2000s and lived through the initial buzz and phenomena of the American Pie movies. I wasn't old enough to actually go see them, but me and my brother would sneakily watch them whenever we could. They had a type of mythos around them for people of my age and revitalised the raunchy comedy genre. We even had films that weren't the same genre marketing themselves as if they were. Some movies even outright stole the logo (Can't Hardly Wait which came out first, but used the exact same logo as AP for subsequent releases).   After the initial three movies that had somewhat diminishing returns, the franchise divulged into yearly straight to dvd releases tethered only by the Stifler name and Eugene Levys wonderful acting. Despite some of these not being that good, they were still kind of big in the sense that the brand never died out. Then 'American Reunion' came out. It was a decent box office success and overall a pretty good film, but for whatever reason we never got a sequel even though one was announced and the cast had even signed onto it.   In the years following that one (it's been over a decade 💀), it has been pretty much crickets. A year or two ago we got a Netflix spin off thing that made ZERO noise whatsoever and I feel like even the original movies have faded into obscurity and have become a forgotten relic of their time.   Where do you think the franchise stands in this current day? Do you think a reboot/remake could happen? Would it even work in this day and age? I recently rewatched and there are a few of them that somewhat stand the test of time (mainly the original, the sequel, reunion and even band camp kind of).",

They had a frickin lore for Santa Claus! A lore that made sense and also explains why he is able to kick such ass. He even has a character arc. It surprised me a lot. The movie had nailed almost every part (a few characters and the last 2 mins nagged me a bit but not much) but honestly no complains.   A major props to action. I thought this would be a fast and furious kinda action - somewhat family friendly and PG at best, but no. I'm glad the filmmakers made the movie so goddamn violent and gory. The movie certainly earned and deserved the title.  David Harbour was amazing! He had no business being that good of a Santa but here we are. Honestly I wouldn't mind watching a sequel for this movie. Alos I would love a prequel explaining Santa's lore because if you watch and for those who have watched know how badass those few glimpses of past were.   Way better than my expectations and surely one of the best action movies of the year that surprisingly has a good story.",

The chapters were so short it made for such an easy read, but one I couldn't put down till I finished. And what a heart-felt emotional climax - one I certainly didn't expect, and was so much better than any movie version's ending I've seen. But I admit I haven't seen them all.  I've obviously watched the Disney animated version, and now I've read the book I can see how they've cleverly implemented various parts of the book to create the shortened down version of the story. The recent live action/cgi version tried to replicate it but with alterations that clearly makes it an inferior version. Then I had high hopes for Guillermo Del Toro's new stop-motion version. But having just finished it, I actually think it is unfortunately the furthest from the book. They changed/added so much it's almost a whole new story. In fact I'd go so far to say I won't be watching it again anytime soon as it left me very disappointed.  This leads me to ask has anyone seen other more obscure versions of the tale, and are they closer to the book? I don't think there'll be anything exact as there is so much that happens in the book in such a short amount of pages. But I'm interested to know about all the different versions out there.",

        "body": "I recently watched Nope (2022) and was quite intrigued/excited to see what it was about. I had a general idea about flying saucers, mystery and perhaps some Jordon Peele-esque allusions to things like filmmaking/sci-fi tropes/etc.   This film made no sense, and almost all of the elements are undercooked and half-baked in my sure-to-be-flamed opinion ;)   Let's start with the obvious flaws:  1. D. Kaluuya - acting was catatonic and truly uninspired. I like this dude, but I wouldn't call this a high point for him AT ALL. His arc in this story also made no sense and random is what I would describe his impact. For some reason lots of people give him the benefit of the doubt here but I'm not seeing it. Could possibly be replaced by pretty much any comparable actor in this role.   2. Steven Yeun's character - probably the most intriguing part of the story, made no sense. And this comes from a Twin Peaks fan who often looks for underlying meaning to subtle plot points and general mood that probably goes nowhere but up a butthole lol. There was lots of slow-zooms and mysterious camera angles but ultimately his arc didn't accomplish anything except be a red herring? Maybe I'm missing something but my general feeling is there were cuts made to his side of the story and it messed up the meaning. Anyone agree? I truly like Yeun as an actor but this just wasn't it.  3. The monkey scenes. I mean, this piqued my curiosity throughout, and I was begging for it to come back round and imbue the film with a underlying message of....something...anything...I'm truly confused about what Peele thought he was communicating here with these vignettes? Once again, maybe I'm missing something so if someone can help, that would be appreciated.  4. The ending: To me, a good ending has to have some level of threat or risk involved. The good guys have to overcome or not overcome a challenge and this leads to a satisfying conclusion (for me personally). However, like other not-so-good films I've seen, this threat is never really present, and the good guys kind of accomplish...something...just in the nick of time? Before what?  5. That saucer: now I know this is a personal subjective thing, but for some reason, the flying cowboy hat with a butthole never truly landed for me...Maybe he was trying to say something about filmmakers being up their own butts? Truly baffling stuff. It kinda ruined my immersion and I think a more traditional saucer would actually have helped since the overt mixing tropes and allusions kind of muddled an already muddled story.  Sorry for the long ramble, I'm truly looking for some discussion around these points in good faith. I realise lots of people liked this film but I wouldn't give this anything higher than The Matrix Resurrections, which was also a truly confusing journey from a filmmaker probably overstretching themselves. Also if I need to censor anything in the post please let me know - trying to be vague as possible for those who haven't seen it.",

Adam Sandler in Uncut Gems, just superb and nothing there either...Jim Carey for Truman Show? Eli Wallach for The Good The Bad and The Ugly, Peter Sellers for Clouseau!  There always seems to be a trend of comedic actors/performances not being taken as serious/award worthy...which leads me to my personal, crazy overlooked performance though is Dan Aykroyd in Trading Places - his Ivy League breeding performance is astonishing, blended out with brilliant comedic chops (every scene as the drunk Santa).

        "title": "My analysis of Guillermo del Toro's Pinocchio",
        "body": "Alongside Marcel the shell, Guillermo del Toro's Pinocchio has been one of the year's best animated films. The effort and attention to detail were spectacular and the immersion in each scene transported the audience to Italy; the constant references to culture (artists, songs, etc.) also complemented each scene perfectly. Aside from the wrapping, the film is way much more than that, this is a film that tries to be a lot and actually achieves it, it is a movie with a really particular way of seeing life and it shows; but the key to understanding it all is the portrait of Arthur Schopenhauer that the talking cricket was hanging inside Pinocchio.  First of all, from the fact that the cricket has a portrait of Schopenhauer on its wall and that its mouth looks like a mustache, the talking cricket clearly represents Nietzsche and throughout the movie, the lines it gives can be interpreted as an exposition of the will to power: a will to strive to be more, to overcome oneself, to value high art and its impact on the human soul, and to value love and personal relationships as a way to overcome the nihilism of life, of finding joy in the sorrow of life.  This takes us to the second point, nihilism. Nihilism is probably the main topic throughout the film, it is depicted with the before and after scenes of Geppetto losing Pinocchio to an event that had little to do with any of the character's actions, it shows how life can be brutal to those who deserve the least suffering. The sorrow of Geppetto after losing Pinocchio is the perfect way of depicting nihilism in the movie. The other way in which nihilism is represented is by the death which Pinocchio visits after dying; the death explains to Pinocchio that he is immortal to which Pinocchio answers excited saying it's a blessing, but then the death explains its rather a curse because if life is sorrow, then a never-ending life is a never-ending sorrow, the death explains that Pinocchio will have to see all his loved ones die.  Finally, the last and key element which helps understand the film is the pinecone Pinocchio gives Geppetto before dying. Geppetto then plants the seed of which a tree grows, a tree that also gave pinecones, and the tree that he will later cut down to build Pinocchio.  So how does this all make sense? Well, \\*spoilers ahead\\* at the ending we see that the four characters (Pinocchio, Geppetto, the talking cricket, and Spazzatura) have returned home from their adventure and we see them live together. Spazzatura, Pinocchio, and Geppetto were suffering characters, and even though the cricket embraced life he suffered too; in the end, all the characters found joy in their relationships, in commiseration with one another they found the key against the sorrow of life, they understood each other perfectly and what they were going through, and they embraced those relationships. This is really similar to the philosophy of Arthur Schopenhauer and his explanation of suffering; he argued that a will to exist moved all living organisms and that therefore suffering was the general rule by which we lived our lives; furthermore, he mentioned that a way of alleviating the pain was by understanding our fellow men and every living creature as he who suffers too because he too is possessed by the will to exist.  The characters embraced life and overcame its sorrow, but the ending scene was that of Pinocchio in the grave of the ones he loved the most; because he was immortal, he saw them all die, and the movie's final shot was that of a pinecone falling. Once again, Schopenhauer's philosophy makes this message clear with the following quote: “individuals in the strange form of their customs and pursuits, and then interpose with the question: Whence will all these come? Where are they now? Where is the fertile womb of that nothing, pregnant with worlds, which still conceals the coming races? Would not the smiling and true answer to this be, Where else should they be than there where alone the real always was and will be, in the present and its content?-thus with thee, the foolish questioner, who in this mistaking of his own nature is like the leaf upon the tree, which, fading in autumn and about to fall, complains at its destruction, and will not be consoled by looking forward to the fresh green which will clothe the tree in spring, but says lamenting, I am not these! These are quite different leaves! Oh, foolish leaf! Whither wilt thou? And whence should others come? Where is the nothing whose abyss thou fearest? Know thine own nature, that which is so filled with thirst for existence; recognize it in the inner, mysterious, germinating force of the tree, which, constantly one and the same in all generations of leaves, remains untouched by all arising and passing away.” In the end, Pinocchio was a leaf that understood its own nature and life embraced him back.  The film was also full of references to Catholicism, nationalism, and greedy materialism, which can be understood as ways of coping with reality. Pinocchio saw the twilight of those idols and embraced the true meaning of his nature as a living being.  Pd: Geppetto suffered the most because his son died, his chance of existing after his death, he was unfulfilled will and therefore he was suffering.  Pd 2: The other magical entity of the movie was the counterpart of the death, which is life or by the terms of this analysis the representation of the will to exist.",

My choices, so far.  1. *Lost Highway* (1997) - The theatrical trailer never fails to torment by brilliantly juxtaposing David Lynch's trademark elements with the frightening surrealism of Fred Madison's encounter with the Mystery Man and the lost highway. The editing sound mixing with Marilyn Manson's *I Put a Spell On You* is immaculate. 2. *The Insider* (1999) - Michael Mann's masterpiece was sold correctly in its theatrical trailer, which is more suspenseful than 98% of horror trailers. The ticking of the *60 Minutes* clock over the film's title seals the deal.",

Sicario  &#x200B;  For La la Land, it was a musical and I'm not into musicals, and on top of that, it was about a pianist, and since I play piano I feared that they would botch that part up.  When I saw it later, I realize I was being silly.  It was just a fantastic film.     For Sicario, I read a film critic's review in a newspaper.  He said that Sicarios was so-so, because the female protagonist was weak character.  I was disappointed, and didn't go.  I saw it later, and realize that the reviewer did not understand the cinematic role of the female protagonist played.  It was stupid.  And I kicked myself for not going to the theater because of a bad review.",

They're both great films, but Alien is so much more realistic, artistic, creepy and well acted/written/directed. A far, far more effective dark sci-fi movie. Aliens has good sci-fi still, but the writing sucks, the aliens look like crap most of the time and the acting is SO cringe except for Lance Henricksen as Bishop. Sigourney Weaver's performance is so corny and never believable, which is weird considering how good she is in Alien. Plus, it's a military, whip out the giant guns movie. I just think it's so dull compared to the original which to me is a work of art by H.R. Giger and Dan O'Bannon.",

It blew my mind how amazing the landscape, creatures, and nature looked (action scenes looked video gamey) but the water in particular looked superb. I would not have been able to tell it was CGI at all.   However, I've heard a lot of people say 3D is gimmicky. 3D has been around a long time, and I remember watching movies back in the day where it was just items popping out and coming towards you (a cheap gimmick back then I admit). The last 3D movie I saw was Avatar, and I recall that being really good too. Fleshed out backgrounds, and I swear lighting wise I knew the lighting is the same in 2D vs. 3D, but the background stuff that pops out just looks better lighting wise. In my brain I go, oh yeah that's far more natural lighting. And while the previous Avatar was good, I could easily tell what was just background popping up and what was in 2D (i.e. I could differentiate between the 2D and 3D sections), whereas in Avatar 2 they seem to mend together seamlessly. It doesn't just feel like a 2D object being projected in 3D, but a 3D object I am a part of (if that makes sense).   I haven't really heard anything about 3D outside of it's just a cheap gimmick. I myself haven't seen a 3D movie since the previous Avatar because I just didn't want to pay the higher price for it. But the difference between a 2D movie, and 3D Dolby Cinema movie is insane. The increased level of immersion I felt was significantly higher (and I didn't even particularly like Avatar 2), and I feel it has significantly improved since the first Avatar.",

Home Alone 1 & 2 are amazing movies, and they deserve all the respect they get because they started it all. I will never stop watching them every year, but I will be adding Home Alone 3 to my annual Christmas movie watch list. The main reason that I think it is better is because it's writing is way better. I never realized until this latest rewatch that Hughes wrote the 3rd movie (and actually didn't write the 2nd).   The story is much more cohesive, and makes way more sense to me. First off, the kid actually tries to call the cops multiple times and only resorts to fending off the criminals himself because nobody listens to him. Second, the villains have an actual reason to keep pursuing the kid because the chip is worth so much. I never understood why Harry and Marv didn't just stop after the second trap, because they could have just left and probably never been caught.  The characters are all just better in general too. Alex is so much more likeable than Kevin, because Kevin is kind of a little monster. He hates his family and is happy they are gone? That is horrendous and abusive. The 3rd movie is centered around a more normal family that I can relate to way more.  To just kind of sum it all up I think Home Alone 3 has less plot holes, more likeable characters, and is generally more entertaining. I've seen negative posts about it before and I think everyone should at least give it a try to decide for yourself.",

War movie - soldiers are in trenches and they despise one of their comrades because his dad is a high ranking military official so he gets preferential treatment in the trench. There's a mission where a group of them need to reestablish a communication wire that was severed in no man's land. The privileged soldier's only job is to sound a whistle if he sees enemies advancing on his comrades. He sees enemies but is too scared to whistle so his comrades die while he crawls back and reports to command that he did everything he could. Except, one of the squad members survives the attack, comes back to the trench, and reports that the privileged soldier did not sound the whistle and that's why the mission failed. May have been in black and white 50/50.    .  2. Gangster/mob movie. A crippled mob boss in a wheelchair and his right hand are in a dim workshop interrogating one of the gang members that failed an assignment. While the boss is making the failed member feel like he's ok and forgiven, he asks his right hand to find a pair of scissors. His right finds a small set, mob boss says asks for something bigger. They keep talking. Right hand finds bigger scissors, mob boss says they need even bigger scissors. Mob boss asks failed member what he likes to do - the answer is dance with his wife.

There's almost always a character who converts, and in every film I've seen where this happens, the character is either mad at god or has never had anyone told them that Jesus died for their sins.      I always consider this incredibly lazy writing. A flat out refusal to engage with the ideas of actual non Christians, and I've never seen a film actually try to engage with another religion (God's Not Dead kinda pretends to do this but the convert from Islam is already converted and trying to hide it from her family, so I don't count it).

'cause while i appreciate the message about overcoming depression and finding self-worth, i can't help but feel it also sends an implicit false message that *every* person brings this dramatically abundant amount of value to the world. and also, i feel like the movie should've chosen a more average person to convey that message, instead of someone who has literally saved people's lives and prevented multiple deaths and tragedies ('cause realistically, most people have never done that).   i know what the movie was trying to do with the message, and while i respect that, i personally think it pushed the boundaries a little too much with how much good things he was responsible for. for example, of *course* if someone saves their brother's life and helps their family have a successful career, that person automatically has a lot of value and purpose by default. but those things, along with other extreme examples of this him existing being the better reality thing, are not even close the lives of the vast majority of people. if you choose an exaggeratedly prolific person in their good deeds, like the protagonist in this movie, of *course* it's gonna be easy to point out why he should've been born and why he shouldn't kill himself. but most people simply are not nearly as important as that and will never be. and that's where i criticize it, 'cause if you're gonna send this message to the viewers, and if you want it to really stick the way you want to, then you must choose a more average, relatable protagonist.  so, overall, do i think it's a wonderful life is a bad movie? no. i still think it's a fairly decent movie in general, despite my mixed feelings. and i'm curious to hear what others think.",

For me, I had a prediction for Avatar 2 and the sequels, that maybe they'd explore the idea of there being bad/evil Na'vi, because, well...if there are good and bad humans then it can be assumed there are bad Na'vi as well as good na'vi, and while the Recoms kindof fulfilled that role, it still wasn't what I was expecting, also I don't think they will because that may contradict the themes Cameron wants for the series and what he wants the Na'vi to represent, not too mention, like I said, the Recoms seem to be fulfilling that role in some way.  Another prediction I had that didn't come true is that, well, I thought that that the Spiderman NWH was going have a new post credits scene maybe setting up plot point for Spiderman 4, like maybe have Kingpin running for Mayor, or Revealing Mysterio was still alive and somehow still retains the memories of Peter, or God forbid, Morbius, Vulture, and Aaron Taylor-Johnson Kraven find a way into the MCU, and while there was a new post credits scene, it clearly wasn't any of those.  Finally, the last prediction I had that didn't came true was that Smile was secretly a sequel to Truth or Dare, you know, that stupid Blumhouse Horror movie/film. That prediction was mostly from just seeing the teaser for the first time when I went to go see Top Gun Maverick and not knowing what it was at first, of course was I did more research on it, I quickly found out that prediction clearly can't be true.  TLDR: I had predictions for Avatar 2 and sequels that the story would explore the idea of good and evil Na'vi, but this did not happen. I also predicted that the Spiderman NWH movie would have a post-credits scene setting up a plot point for Spiderman 4, but this did not happen either.

There's definitely some really good elements to Inception, like the loaded cast and acting of course. Using the first half of the movie for world building was also nice. And the visuals and action sequences were great. So it's not bad by any means.  And yet, Inception's plot didn't manage to feel...convincing? Maybe it's because I wasn't really attached to any of the characters emotionally, or the concept of levels of dreams was interesting but not executed well (in my opinion). In the second half, the movie tries to do so much in a short amount of time that I stopped getting heavily invested. I've seen people online saying Inception is enjoyable if it's not taken seriously, which would be fine, but...the movie takes itself seriously by spending so much time on world building that I feel like I should try to oblige.   Inception already feels outdated as a mind-bending movie, which is disappointing because of how critically acclaimed it is. The Prestige, Nolan's work that came out 4 years earlier, has aged much better in my opinion. Maybe because it has a much simpler presentation that constantly convinces and hooks the viewer.",

I wouldn't necessarily ask for a Sam Elliott or a John Wayne type that would just turn the movie into a caricature of itself and I am guessing director Jane Campion wanted avoid that partly by casting him for the role but I think it was too far out of the expectations which made him stick out in a bad way. I remember thinking to myself while watching, this is a great story but I keep losing my immersion every time Cumberbatch appears on the screen.  I still to this day don't get the casting of Edward Norton for the Hulk.",

Why can't we have a movie about scientists reacting logically and rationally? Why can't a sci-fi movie about people without emotional callbacks exist? A crisis movie without any family, like Godzilla, and purely scientists and military discussing how to deal with it would be quite **awesome**.  Am I crazy? Why is there a need to humanize characters no matter what?  The closest to what I want is Star Trek TNG, where people behave in a goal oriented way, without much emotion.

Now, my personal favorites are scores that I consider 10/10: they have enhanced the cinematic experience by elevating the films they were  written for to new heights, and both integrate perfectly into the film as well as stand out as a stand-alone listening experience.  **Babylon**, Justin Hurwitz.  Amazing film, amazing score, I've had it on repeat  since the day the score was released.  Lovely style throughout, killer melodies, incredibly in-your-face in the best of ways.  **Glass Onion**, Nathan Johnson.  Also an amazing film with an amazing score.  The  score fit perfectly, was allowed to really be a character in the film, and I love the overall classic-hollywood-murder-mystery style that was allowed to be really prominent.  **All Quiet on the Western Front**,   Volker Bertelmann.  A surprising stand out film and score for me; it's an utterly visceral film that I think everyone should watch.  The  score legitimately gave me goosebumps a few times, and really added to the viewing experience.  And it makes me feel all sorts of things listening to it on its own.  **Station 11**, Dan Romer.  Beautiful show with a beautiful & eclectic score.  The show came out end of '21 but the score wasn't released until '22, so I'm counting it as a 2022 score release.  The stand out tracks make me want to sit and weep because things are beautiful and heartbreaking at  the same  time.  **House of the Dragon**,  Ramin Djawadi.  One of the few elements that maintained quality throughout GOT was Djawadi's score, and his work on HOTD did not disappoint.  I loved the show and loved the score more.     The  following scores are 10/10's in that they were utterly fantastic in the  context of the films they were written for, but are not ones I've actively sought out or felt was a great listening experience on their  own (though that's certainly subject to change!):  **The Banshees of Inisherin** by Carter Burwell, **Bones and All** by Reznor/Ross, **Everything Everywhere All at Once** by Son Lux, **Where the Crawdads Sing** by Mychael Danna, **Nope** by Michael Abels, **Top Gun Maverick** by Zimmer/Balfe/Faltermeyer/Gaga, **The Batman** by Michael Giacchino, and **Andor** by Nicholas Britell.     And then scores that I generally liked but have some form of a caveat, keeping them out of my favorites for the year:  **Prey**, Sarah Schachner.  This one ALMOST made it to my personal favorites but not quite.  Phenomenal score for a surprisingly great movie with a few  stand out tracks, would highly recommend anyone see it who has not.  **Kenobi**, John Williams.  The main theme was great, but that's the only thing I really enjoyed.  **The Rings of Power**, Bear McCreary.  There's parts I liked and it generally fit the show well, but it somehow lacked heart and isn't something I've enjoyed by itself.  **Black Panther Wakanda Forever**, Ludwig Göransson.  Solid score, some really dope added elements with the Mayan materials, but as a whole I didn't love the score as much as I would have liked.  **Turning Red**, Ludwig Göransson.  I've only heard a few tracks from it and have not seen the movie but WOW those few tracks are perfect.  **Kimi**, Cliff Martinez.  A bit of a departure from what I'm used to hearing Martinez do, but I liked it in the film!  **Women Talking,**   Hildur Guðnadóttir.  I haven't seen the movie yet and have only heard parts of the score, but the parts I've heard are great and, like Martinez, a departure from what I'm used to hearing with her scores.  **Jurassic World Dominion** by Michael Giacchino, **Doctor Strange Mutiverse of Madness** by Danny Elfman, and **Thor Love and Thunder** by Michael Giacchino.  These three were all fine...the scores generally fit the movies well, but there's things I really wished had been changed or done differently, and they ultimately fell a little flat for me even if  there's tracks in them all that I enjoyed.  Apologies for the hugely long and rambling post...I get excited talking about film scoring, clearly.  What scores have you really enjoyed this year?  Are there ones I'm missing that I really need to hear?",

        "body": "Unlike Wayne's World, Highlander and Flash Gordon have Queen music that was written specifically for their films. That means that Freddie Mercury said 'yeah these two movies are worthy of our music, lads'. Even going so far as to have music videos featuring the movies. And not just a song they thought sounded cool... lyrics that reference the films. 'Flash' more so, of course, but 'Princes of the Universe' is pretty heavily influenced by Highlander aswell.    So if you originally have these movies at a 6/10... I think the addition of Queen should boost them up to at least an 8/10. Cause to fair, no other film can ever have Queen do their soundtrack. Sure, you can get Brian May to write it... but without Freddie it wouldn't be the same.    Now I'm not here to pretend Queen is everyone's taste... but I think you have to respect the fact that the band only ever did original songs for these two movies. Regardless of reason or circumstances. That makes them unique films. Rare, perhaps?     I will also shout-out Labyrinth whilst I'm here. Not only did David Bowie do every single song... even the baby vocals... but he also acted and helped with the dance choreography in the film. And Freddie and David were both friends. So it's all connected. May they both rest in peace.",

And I honestly didn't think it was that bad. I'm not saying it was good, far from it. Sandra Bullock (Annie) and Jason Patric (Alex) severely lacked the chemistry that the Sandra Bullock and Keanu Reeves (Jack) had but Willem Dafoe (Geiger) always plays a good bad-guy and there is enough action, jeopardy and humour to keep you mildly entertained throughout.   I thought the introduction was actually quite good, it showed Annie is still the same loveable goof as from the first film and Alex although not as bad-ass as Jack does have something about him. Fairly quickly after they get on the boat it starts to kick off, straight in to the action which was another positive. It's always nice to see the 'bad-guy' thwarting the 'good-guys' first few attempts at 'saving the day' (admittedly it would be nice if he did more than tap a few keys on a keypad to do it but i get it, he's a hacker) and much like the first one It's not quite as simple as surviving the initial threat.  Admittedly the beginning of the end sequence is pretty interminable, after they narrowly avoid the oil tanker they then proceed with a drawn out, slow collision with a harbour, which felt so unnecessarily long and entirely predictable. I don't know if this was left in to just pad the length of the movie or what but it just feels so anti-climatic.   Ultimately I just think that's its an average film, it doesn't do anything really well and has plenty of flaws but a score of 4% on rotten tomatoes seems harsh.",

Instead, a third act is tacked on that feels out of place.   Overall,  the movie makes me wish that William Dafoe had been in more war movies, specifically serious war movies.  Every scene is better for him being in it.    I would give it a 6.5-7.0.  It is worth a watch and is entertaining even if a little flawed.",

This isn't as bad as that, but I still didn't really care for it overall.  First of all, this is kind of a nitpick, but it looks pretty flat and lifeless. The first one had that low tech grainy cinematography was cool to look at, and the second one looked more like a studio film. But this one just looks kind of like a cheap TV show. The shots are all boring and it just has a janky low budget feel that isn't charming like the first one.  But more importantly I just don't really care for the direction they go with this one. It's a lot more serious than the other two, which I don't inherently have a problem with, but if they were gonna do that they should've gone full drama in my opinion. As is, it still tries to have the same wacky humor, and much like Jay and Silent Bob Reboot, it's not a very funny movie in my opinion.  I also don't think Kevin Smith going more and more meta and self-indulgent is helping anything. Almost every story point in this is based on something from his own life, so it was hard for me to get into the story since it kept winking at the camera. It also doesn't help that the second half is getting over almost entirely too re-creating stuff from the first one, constantly reminding you of how much more clever and interesting it was.  And I just fundamentally disagree with the decision to >!kill Becky and Dante.!< It just didn't feel earned to me based on how the characters have developed over the three films, and the character beats that result from it feel recycled from the other two, almost like the characters are going backwards.  It's not a complete loss. I laughed a couple times and I do care enough about these characters that I'm glad there was an attempt to pour a lot of pathos and empathy into them. I just don't think it worked. Am I crazy here? If you liked the other two, what did you think of this?",

In the middle of the movie I had a very strong impression this entire movie was a prank, designed to appear like a normal innocuous movie for the first 30 minutes-or-so-before it shifts to a bonkers parody. Like it literally feels like a comedy.  Spoilers with some of the plot details I can remember: >!The boyfriend gets replaced with an alien, but theres a surprsingly effective misdirection where the movie frames it as though the girlfriend was the one who got replaced. The alien's powers are really just a super-cheap looking long CGI finger knife which seems more goofy than menacing! The alien eventually confronts her, realizing the jig is up, but then is like I absorbed your bf's feelings! Including his love for you! I love you! So the aliens just chasing after her around the woods shouting but I really love you! like some cheesy romcom. By this point I had given up completely and then was won back by the sheer gall of it. Eventually the alien copies the girl, and then to defeat her the girl is like you absorbed my anxiety disorder as well! and then induces a literal panic attack in the alien by just listing things humans get anxious about. Eventually toward the end of the movie she has to outsmarts the alien by swimming into the ocean while hes bleeding and he follows her into the water and gets attacked by A FUCKING SHARK!! WHAT! Then it has a this invasion is just the beginning lame ending.!<  Theres probably some details im forgetting",

I'd been hearing all about this great twist forever, and how King liked it better than his own ending, so admittedly my expectations were moderately high.  We get started and my brain starts immediately connecting dots- our main man is a scifi artist, spooky military fog happens, and all of a sudden we've got unseen scifi monsters roaming about.   Then we get evidence of one of the creature's tentacles- but it mysteriously disappears when the strong-minded guy who doesn't believe in that shit comes to look.  Then crazy lady starts telling everyone it's bible shit and we get swarms of locusts. She believes that God will save her when one of them lands on her, and in response to her prayers it flies off and leaves her alone. People start listening to the main guy, and then to her, and the more scared people are and the more they believe, the crazier shit gets.   By the end I was 100% convinced that the mist was a military experiment or otherdimensional phenomenon used to manifest people's fears and beliefs into reality, responding most strongly to those with the strongest imaginations/personal realities (the artist, the pragmatist, the madwoman.)  It was such a beautiful metaphor- the mist as a physical manifestation of humanity's imaginations and their fear of the unknown. Showing how mob mentality takes us over, and an individual's reality can be subsumed by groupthink (the pragmatist who later gets killed at the pharmacy.) Warring ideologies made manifest. How humanity is often its own worst enemy, allowing our fears to drive us to create a reality that's so much worse than it needs to be (since none of that shit would have happened if they could've stopped being fear-driven dicks for like 5 seconds.)  But no, the bullshit “fog dimension to an alternate monster universe” strawman is actually what they decided to go with, ~~with pointless killing of a kid thrown in to boot (and by the way did they HAVE to make the kid wake up in time to see his dad shoot him? Dicks.)~~  Fuck you, whoever came up with that lame ass ending.  /rant   Edit: It seems like everyone is fixating on the kid killing thing. That was a bit of a throwaway comment, sorry to trigger y'all. Up with the kid deaths in media.  My main bone is with what the mist eventually wound up being- a portal to interdimensional monsters rather than an allegorical tool manifesting the fears and internal realities of those who come into contact with it.",

I thought i'd watch it on VHS and i honestly think the VHS and dvd versions of the movie are unmatched because of how imperfect and sort of dirty the film looks.

        "body": "I'm writing a movie currently that is a sort of psycho thriller. I don't want to give away too many details because it is a major project of mine but think along the lines of a fight club/American psycho/Donnie darko type film. There are a lot of motorcycle racing scenes on the street designed to cause chaos and fear in both the civilians in the movie and to the audience. I'm very good at writing deep, meaningful, confusing, ontologically monstrous, cosmically horrifying material but I struggle with the more fundamental action, explosions, chaos, suspense, aspects of the film. What are some good tips or key things to hit on to make sure the reader is pulled into the action?  I love good chase scenes. Some of my favorites is the motorcycle chase with the cop at the beginning of First Blood and pretty much every car chase in Ronin is amazing. However I'm looking to make these motorcycle scenes as intense and suspenseful as possible while still being objectively entertaining with lots of cool classic cinematic chase  cameos and whatnot (accidental alliteration). Any advice or suggestions is appreciated.",

An absolutely masterful plan all around that was decades in the making. IMO, there is nothing that comes close to changing a millennia old galactic status quo with literally 3 words.

If Grand Budapest Hotel is pattern and symmetry, The French Dispatch is stylized asymmetrical symmetry and balance. (at least that's how my One art class brain saw it)Each scene is designed with enough intricate detail to convince me that Wes Anderson is an artistic genius. And you can really chew on the dialogue in both movies. They will also remind you of your poor vocabulary. Grand Budapest is a fast-paced, unrealistic adventure drama, while French Dispatch is a slower “love letter to journalists that brings a collection of stories to life.” I went down a rabbit hole reading about Wes Anderson. He's written and directed nine other movies with the same A-list actors. Another is coming out next year with Benedict Cumberpatch called The Wonderful Henry Sugar I plan to watch every movie within the next few weeks.",

He says “Belle, it's me” and she looks at him with confusion and not believing what she physically just witnessed. She has to touch his hair and look at him further even though just a few seconds ago she watched him physically transform in front of her.  If she was not physically next to him when he transformed back, this reaction would have been a lot more believable, but the fact she saw it happen never sat well with me.

It honestly feels like the futurama joke of a film in slow motion, nothing of interest happens the entire time. Characters just seem to get on with the plot, and the plot is the most generic blockbuster plotline I've ever seen, especially when you consider at least the standard generic blockbuster has a bloody ending! This film just stopped and I remember being in the cinema, everyone clapping and being happy and that and just thinking what the fuck did we see a different film? It was the worst movie I've ever seen in the cinema and that includes when I saw Grown Ups 2 with Adam Sandler (at least it was half the length and had jokes that even if they didn't make you laugh got some kind of reaction out of you).  I tried watching it again today and I had to turn it off an hour and a half in. Even the beautiful cinematography the film is praised for feels dull to me. Big empty halls of brown with a bit of light, and characters that sit there reading the script with zero emotion. Nothing stands out, there's a 10 minute long bit where he talks to a gardener and the gardener is like these trees are so important then the trees get burnt down half an hour later and it was filmed like that was a big emotional moment. Seriously, whilst I weren't a fan of the book I could at least understand who it was after, it had a great plot with complicated characters and there was no clear good guys and bad guys. But in this film the good guys go out of their way to save people, and the bad guys all look like nazis living on their big nazi planet. Fuck me. What a waste of time, not for me watching it, but for all the cast and crew that spent months/years of their life on the most intricately painted yellow/grey wall ever.",

While box office is not always the best criteria, most of the times it does work. The Shawshank Redemption is one of the few movies that consistently reminds me that Box Office is not everything.  When it comes to movies on streaming though, it's based on Word of Mouth from Youtube. I've found that rotten tomatoes reviews and even Top 10 trending charts don't matter cause the former most of the times is too less and the latter can be easily manipulated by the streamer. Mostly the streaming movies sucked but I came to love Tomorrow War and Do Revenge based on YouTube recommendations.  I sometimes use critic reviews and IMDb reviews in case of tie breaks.

In my mind it's among Giuseppe Tornatore's very best work.  The audience rating of this film on IMDB is 7.4 though, therefore I wanted to hear what others consider as flaws or weaknesses in this movie requiring a few points deduction.

We are then brought to the inferno that was Laurie's house, firemen arrive, Michael opens that sliding door to reveal himself, then he slaughters them all in super cool ways and I do wish we got to see him kill them all.....  Then we see him go to that old couple and he kills the husband, nearly kills the wife but she survives as seen in Ends of course.....  After this the movie only goes from bad to worse, suffering from really bad writing, characters being total dumbasses, cringey Shakespearean dialogue, severe lack of logic all over, and the ending being completely meaningless given everything that happens in Ends. Plus.....they fucked that mob mentality subplot up all to hell because of the actor they went with for that.....the Penguin, instead of someone who could pass for James Jude Courtney's stunt double or something.

For many reasons, such as Billy Bob Thortons performance, his characters dynamic with the kid being very well done and believable, the kid himself, whole you could argue can be alittle bit annoying at times, still very sincere and still feels like a realistic portrayal of a kid, and his nonchalant reactions to Willys outburst are just hilarious, to the other characters also being very memorable, to the comedy just being so funny, like, I was laughing like crazy throughout the film.  But I think the reason I move it the most, is that despite it being a very un-convential Christmas movie, it actually has a very positive and feel good message. Yes it does have raunchier humor and darker moments, but at its core it still has a great message about not being alone, Bonding with others, and changing for the better. It's kindof like an R-rated version of the Grinch, actually. So despite being a Un-Convential Christmas film, still manages to also feel like a traditional Christmas film simultaneously as well. Also, it's just a really funny movie. My favorite scenes being with the kid with the ice cream, his freak out in the food court, and the scene of him driving the kid back home.   So yeah, great movie, easily one of the funniest Christmas movies of all time, but also one of my top 5 most favorite/best Christmas/holiday movies of all time. I couldn't recommend it enough.",

The script is very good, but the direction actively hindered my ability to be affected by the characters' plight. The camera moves without reason and slow motion shots / melodramatic music jars you in moments that would otherwise be impacting. Every time I was being pulled into the film, the director would do some unnecessary and unenjoyable stylistic flourish that pulled me out and reminded me I was watching a movie.  Awhile ago I watched a movie, based on a play, that entirely takes place at a police station as a black mother and her white detective husband grapple with the news that their son has been killed by cops. I was continually distracted because the director could not just plant the camera and let the actors convey, reserving the camera movement for when it would be most powerful tool. Instead, the camera was constantly tracking in, out and laterally for absolutely no reason whatsoever. Camera movements convey meaning and, when a director is aware of how the camera motion will affect the audience, can be used to greatly enhance the viewer's experience: random camera movements do the opposite.  Anyways, I thought I'd vent and get downvoted. Can you think of any movies with great scripts and bad direction?",

While the cinematography is great as is the action, the words in between and during & their delivery by everyone from the main characters to one-offs are what make it such a strong film.  *Snatch* does the same with pretty much every role. I don't know that every single accent is accurate, but the way it's sold makes the audience feel like they must be and almost everything that's said helps drive the film rather than just filling up time.   *Nightcrawler*, *Michael Clayton*, and *Wind River* would be some others that come to mind where in spite of physical action and constant rising tension from the plots themselves, the dialogue serves as the strongest feature to establish characters, the world, the mood, the danger, and so on.

The rovers themselves feel like actual people and the effects are done by ILM, so they're great. IMO should be required viewing in all high schools.",

        "title": "The Menu and Midsommar: Stalinism and Fascism",
        "body": "Spoilers :   Many people have noted the similarities between these films : a group of outside observers stumble onto a community at which point, with a building sense of dread, they uncover the dark, violent intensions that this group has for them. Both prey on a sense of guilt that is uncovered in the protagonists. Both engage in a violent reaction against consumerist, egotistical modern society. And both , of course, end in fire. However, despite the similarities, I think that the two communities, the Chefs and the Swedish village, represent radically opposite political idealogies: communism and fascism respectively.    Midsommar makes it references to fascism obvious. As soon as the anthropologists land in Sweden there is a huge banner advertising a far right anti-immigrant political party. The community, like fascism, is based in obscure mythical origins and a violent commitment to tradition. And it's appeal (as shown in the infamous crying scene) is based, like fascism, in the sense of community and belonging missing in the modern world.    The Menu is less obvious , but at least clear in the anti -capitalist designs of the chef collective. Ralph Fiennes chef repeatedly calls out how the rich and money pervert his restaurant. The bankers are selfish, corrupt, assholes. One character is labeled guilty just because she was rich enough to not have to take out student loans. The reduction of everyone to simply “chef” instead of their names mirrors the universalizing title of comrade in communism. There is no commitment to tradition, only an ideal. And like Stalinism, and unlike in Midsommar of fascism, the terrifying sense of guilt cannot be escaped, there is no one group that is elevated above the others, and even the chefs themselves carrying out this violence are guilty and have to die.    Some might call this a reach but I think at least the fact that both movies are very political is undeniable.",

It still manages to keep true to the original story, but still also manages to have that classic Muppets feeling to it. The brilliance of having Gonzo as Charles Dickens accompanied by Rizzo.  The songs are beautiful and really strike a chord even when you're an adult. I'll admit that I have cried many a times.  The more I watch films as an adult with the ability to really analyse and critically think about them, it makes you appreciate the art of filmmaking and how much heart goes into a project like this. Especially given how important the Muppets themselves are to us. Not just in American culture (I'm not even American myself), but in general.

I am straight and have absolutely no interest whatsoever in LGBT issues or films (though I think I saw Brokeback Mountain when it first released and liked it). Some would mistake my disinterest for some underlying homophobia (alongside some other views I might have).  Why would I decide to even go so far as to pay money to watch this? Other than the good reviews on Rotten Tomatoes, this movie offers a unique and concentrated perspective on HIV/AIDS pandemic in the shadow of which many people of my generation, and those from the 80s and 90s grew up (the fear of that generation, heterosexual or not, was tantamount and still is).  The documentary was made in 2011.  I am glad I took that step outside of my comfort zone, and you should too.  ***Synopsis:***  The documentary goes through the early 80s up to the 90s in the Castro, San Francisco's gay district. It does this via interviewing 3 people who witnessed the era: a man with AIDS (in very good health) since 1980s who witnessed it all (and lost 2 partners to it), another man who volunteered for the SHANTI organisation and later was involved in testing,  a nurse who cared for AIDS patients in hospital, a local flower seller.  ***My review:***  The film does an excellent job in capturing the mood pre-pandemic and explain how the community reacted to its onset. One of the 3 witnesses explains for instance the first time he saw a handmade poster with polaroid pictures in the early 1980s from someone with the gay cancer warning other members of community to be careful.   But the movie goes on to offer amazing back in time remembrance of the almost 16 000 people that died of the disease in San Francisco, before the first treatments had been invented (AZT and other cocktails that we have today, that weren't introduced until 1996).  Furthermore, it is a very human story of how many people in that community banded together, not just in activism to push the government and health officials into greater action, but by forming volunteer groups, charity groups to help those dying and to make their time on earth more bearable.  What the movie does not do is fall into a pit of grievance and blame, nor could I see that much blatantly LGBT about this movie that would scare those off who do not usually watch content labelled as such. I saw a series of very human, without any melodrama, recollections that left me slightly moved by the end of it.  I wish it had been slightly longer, and had stuck more to a fixed chronology of the different milestones in terms of treatment innovations. But the vision of the director may have been slightly different.  &#x200B;  I rate: **85/100**  Recommended if you get the chance to see it (I found it on the film's website).",

Adam Sandler and Andy Samberg were so funny. I saw Brooklyn Nine-Nine and Palm Springs seeing how good Andy was in this movie. 3. Twilight Breaking Dawn Part 2: This is the best Twilight movie(At least that's what IMDb says). The climax was soo good until it wasn't. Anyways, it was entertaining for me. 4. Transformers 4: This one does not have a story but hey who cares as long as things go Kaboom! Bayhem ultra pro max and that was all I needed. 5. Catwoman: Ok. I know Halle Berry got a Razzie for this but the movie was so funny. I think was meant to be. May be it's not. I don't care, I loved every second of it.  P.S. I've listed some trashy movies I loved.

I mean the choreography is good but Ferrell's vocal range just doesn't fit the Broadway show tune style the songs are going for; he's so flat. Octavia Spencer is flat as well. Reynolds is a bit better but he's not great. And Patrick Page, the only professional singer of the cast, barely gets the chance to sing and is cast as the character who is actually trying to stop people from singing.  Also most of the songs sound so...samey and generic. And the songs kind of overtake the movie; there are sections of the movie that are just songs, then long stretches where no singing happens, and then back to song to song back to back.  I kinda wish they just made it a straight out comedy, a sort of modern day Scrooged, rather than just making it a musical honestly.",

Seeing the emperor grow up was so cool, I almost wanted more of him when he was younger. Living in the Castle not being able to leave reminded me a lot of The Truman Show, which I also watched recently (wow to that movie too, definitely deserves it's own post) and there was so much to love. Seeing this old world slowly become Westernized. The bike, the glasses... and them speaking in English the entire time... I don't know why they decided to do that but it added to the surrealism, for better or worse.   The tutor was such a good character too. The wife was awesome too and that scene where the hands undress her as she kissed him... this movie was a fever dream in the best way at times. But then when they left the Castle, it felt like it became a different movie. The Emperor trying to hold onto his power, the only life he's ever known... I don't know enough about the history behind this, so I feel some of this was lost on me but it felt so tragic and I ended up hating and feeling bad for him. He's innocent, I can't blame him for holding onto the life he's ever known but he obviously made some bad decisions. But you can still see the love and goodness in him at odds with who he was taught to be.   Such a complex, fascinating and beautiful movie. Not to mention the SOUNDTRACK was so good. I knew Ryuichi Sakamoto from some other songs so when I saw his name I got so excited yet somehow I was still blown away.   Just wow, really. Such an amazing movie. I had to share my scattered thoughts as I'm on my commute.   How good are this directors other movies? Are there other historical movies that are worth watching in the same vein?

It's genuinely creepy in parts (the rocking horse) and shocking (the locker room) and creative (the chalkboard whirlpool) and some wtf moments. It obviously took inspiration from Carrie, but it wasn't overly blatant. The acting is rather good as well and the special effects were well done for the time.

        "title": "What was your take on the movie 'The Little Things' with Jared Leto, Denzel Washington and Rami Malek",
        "body": "**Spoiler warning**  First off I know I'm late this movies almost 2 years old   I'm trying to convince myself there's more to this movie but it screams Director gone too far in trying to be different without much constructive thought.   If you liked this movie I'd really like to know why and what you're take on it is because I honestly feel like I completely wasted 2 hours of life.    First of all.    Girl is chased on the road at night by a random car and forgets to call  authorities - or anyone.   The chaser stops his vehicle letting her get a sizeable lead on him.   He then creeps his car forward slowly to catch up because science dictates an object travelling 5 miles per hour can catch up to another object doing 30. That's how cars work.   The girl spots an empty gas station that's clearly closed - with her chaser far behind common sense tells her to get out of her vehicle and head to the gas station on foot.   Upon realising the gas stations closed she could get back into her car and speed off but decides she doesn't want to live so she sets off running into some weeds    The chaser at this point whose knowledge of speed has already been proven - slowly walks after the much younger woman whose running for her life.    The chaser is shown to be walking slowly in an area of flat land while the girl is running through weeds yet neither her or the truck driver who turns up see the person chasing her, we assume because the truck drivers never brought up.   We see fairly clearly that the chaser is a man, heavier set but not obese, straight walk, white male wearing a cap with facial hair and short head hair.    So this automatically rules out Albert, Jimmy or Deacon - right.  Ok.    At the end of the movie  Denzels character is still haunted by the past because he's made literally 0 strides in doing anything to solve that - ok?    Rami Maleks character is now also traumatised and kills someone - right.    Turns out Denzel also killed someone except it was a missing person….ok?    Cop and Coroner , fucking, cover up Denzels murder and were clearly willing to let whoever they found for the killings take the wrap for it and continue to let him work on the force - okedoke   But the missing person Denzel shot isn't the only missing person contributing to his trauma this is an irrelevant detail in the arc of the story….ok   Despite being an officer of the law and having a gun Malek becomes Leto's bitch digging all the holes in the world - cool bro.    So we get a 2 hour crime thriller with:   No character progression ☑️   A corrupt police force ☑️   The killers never caught ☑️    Dead girl gives Denzel a foot massage☑️   Rami and Denzel team up for quite literally no reason ☑️   Denzel accusing Jared Leto of having a boner = guilty ☑️   Rami Malek playing a cop who looks and speaks in more creepy fashion than Letos murderer-but-not-a-murderer character ☑️   Girl who was chased by the killer at the start for some reason takes note of Leto despite the fact she didn't see the fucker chasing her at the time.    She sees Jared, for the first time, in handcuffs and decides she needs a better look at him - *sigh* right.    And by the end - everything that happened in the movie becomes null, void and useless - why?    Becuase Albert Palm tree prime suspect is fucking dead.   Whether it was or wasn't him is now irrelevant - if it was he'll never pay and if it wasn't an innocent man's dead and Jimmys off the case anyway.    That's it. That's the conclusion of a 2 hour story    Creepy Albert for some reason has access to a plot of land - he convinces Malek, the police officer with a gun, to get into *his* car and then start digging up random bits of the land    He states that Deacon isn't welcome to join them yet he knows Deacons there, in Alberts time onscreen it's shown he's very aware of Deacons presence when following him - he knows Deacons a police officer whose going to probably notice his partners gone and so is the car he's been tailing all day.    Despite all of this Albert who is clearly not the killer, plans to kill Jimmy - the director who wanted to 'do something different' then has Jimmy smack Albert with a shovel which in typical fashion is enough to kill him instantly.    Nothing is discovered, no one is recovered and nothing really happens.",

Joy leaves the party to commit suicide, this is represented by the everything bagel that is revealed to be a black hole (death) and why Joy asks her mother to “let her go.” Since we know Evelyn repeatedly told her daughter she was getting fat, it is assumed that she probably did say it again in the parking lot but that they probably didn't hug afterwards like Evelyn recalls. Joy most likely went home and poisoned herself with an everything bagel. It is the last 'real' memory Evelyn has of Joy, and it's also why the memory isn't portrayed in another dimension. After the death of their daughter, Waymond continues with the divorce, and Evelyn presumably loses the family business. The memories Evelyn has of Deidra are real, and she absolutely loved her but they are seen as happening in the hotdog dimension because the relationship happens after the events of the movie and while Evelyn's dementia is in a worse state. The movie probably takes place in a much older Evelyn's mind, and the ending we see is how she thinks the events actually took place. We can see one last glimpse into how Evelyn zones out (dementia) right before the closing scene.",

They told you about an hour in that the wife faked it all to get her husband the death penalty and the movie just got better after that. Not only did she do all of that but she actually fakes a whole different crime to another guy and kills him just to get back to her husband.  There was a scene in the hospital where she called out the lead detective or officer for her being incompetent with how she handled the case. Usually in movies it'll be some kind of revenge thing or some way that the cop just HAS to get the truth. There was none of that. In the end there was no savior or magical evidence that arrested her.   They ended it with just truth and I felt that was one of the more realistic ways a movie has ended. I didn't see it coming at all and I actually was just waiting for something. A wire or a mistake. Unrelated but I watched Shutter Island and was much more impressed with the twist in Gone Girl compared to that. Movies always have to let the bad guy get caught. This was a pleasant surprise.

Great stuff  -Seeing Titane, with only a young couple, the young couple then left about a half an hour through it.

A problem I see in these films are that they don't offer solutions to these lonely men, rather they emphasise that there is no exit out of this crazy world and the protagonists of their respective stories continue to suffer and recieve no help for their struggle. Are there any films out there which are able to simultaniously tap into the minds of these lonely men, and also show them that there's a way out of the cycle of loneliness and depression? Lonely men are able to relate towards these characters, but the characters they relate to are given no way to escape their cycle of loneliness, and so these men are gonna start believing that there's no escape for them too. What I believe is needed is a story that can show these men who need desperate help that there's still hope to hold onto, and that this cycle of loneliness isn't forever.",

        "body": "So if you don't know the 300 movies were originally going to spark a full anthology series taking place in different battles across history. Zach Snyder wanted to make a movie taking place in the American Revolution, but Rise of an Empire was so bad he canceled it. So I watched Filmento's take on Rise of an Empire and thought up the perfect idea for a 300-style American war movie. Looking at all the aspects of the other two to make it.   1. Strong character  What made 300 such a good movie was its leading character, Leonidas was the King of Sparta and an inspiration to all of Greece. The movie shows this by having him go through struggles and trials, we see his origins as a young boy who was always on the verge of death and we see how it made him a skilled warrior and aspiring leader. But Rise of an Empire doesn't have that, hell, I don't even remember the main character's name. He's just an Athenian hoplite who killed Xerxes's father and is fighting a fleet that is never given any importance.   This is something we can fix with the Revolutionary War movie, George Washington is already the perfect candidate for the movie. As American history portrays him, he was a Virginian farmer who got selected for the British Army and lead a group of Natives to attack a French fort, triggering the French and Indian War. Already we have a backstory that can be delivered in perfect Zach Snyder fashion. George Washington also had to go through obstacles and challenges, he wasn't a good general in his early time and had to work to be the best, when the nation founded the Articles of Confederation had no way of collecting taxes for the states which caused his men to starve. He and his army were going to collapse until a Mercenary came and helped train the men. Hell, we could even give him John Wick fighting styles to make his character better.   2.  Exaggerated world  The point of 300 was that it was propaganda told by an untrustworthy narrator who explained everything the same as any Greek man in the war would think during ancient times. The Persian army was mostly dudes and skilled warriors, but the movie showed dudes, giant animals, immortal demons, and even whatever the hell that big guy was. Rise of an Empire didn't have this, sure we had dudes in tighty whities killing fully clothed dudes, but that was it. The only cool element of that movie was those shark monsters that are only a dream sequence.   The American Revolution was full of propaganda portraying the British as killers shooting innocent people and Americans as freedom fighters. The British enlisted different types of men to help fight for their cause as well. These included Native American warriors, Hessian Mercenaries, and escaped slaves. Hessians were already seen as boogeyman-type figures by the Colonists so it wouldn't be hard to portray them the same way immortals are portrayed in the movies. They could be these weird green reptilian monsters that speak inhumanely or giant black knights on horseback chopping people's heads off. Natives obviously could be seen in a similar way.   We could even have creatures from Native American mythology and European lore fighting on both sides creating chaos. Maybe Washington needs the help of an Oneida Shaman who takes him on a drug trip like in a Far Cry game. There could be giant wolves ripping throats or Bigfoot even, that's a no-brainer.   Obviously, historical accuracy wouldn't be a problem here since when did the last two films focus on that?   I'm not saying this would be a good idea, but it at least makes a sequel worthy of 300's name, what are your suggestions?",
