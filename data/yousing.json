        "body": "For those that have no idea what I'm talking about, in 2016, a dystopian film called *The Thinning* was released on YouTube Premium (then known as YouTube Red). The film was directed by Michael Gallagher and stars YouTuber Logan Paul (who has been infamous for many controversies) and actress Peyton List.  To keep things short, the film centered around a future where overpopulation has ravaged the world's resources in 2039 and the United Nations begins to require all nations to cut down their populations by 5%. The United States passes a law that requires students to take a test where the lowest scoring students are executed in order to cut down the population. The film's sequel (*The Thinning: New World Order*) focuses more on exposing a hidden plot within the Thinning surrounding the tech corporation Assuru Global while setting up a rebellion against the system as a heated presidential election takes place.  The films had an interesting (although very flawed) concept and some themes surrounding authoritarianism, democratic backsliding, and the pressure that comes when taking school exams (although once again, very flawed and poorly done). There were even some allusions to real-life with the pro-Thinning Texas governor (who is running for election) in the film essentially representing a Trumpian figure that claims to flush away the parasites along with representing some of the political fears of democratic decline in the United States. However, what made the film very flawed was its poor attempt at worldbuilding (since we never see what the United States is like outside of Texas) and its casting choices since this film was meant for YouTube's targeted teenage audience rather than to make a compelling and interesting story.  Both films ended on a cliffhanger with the second one ending with >!many citizens (including the anti-Thinning presidential candidate and the main characters) being arrested in a political purge (similar to the real-life Night of the Long Knives) instigated by the CEO of the tech corporation Assuru Global (who is also the wife of the Texas governor who ran for the presidency).!< A third film is teased with the characters hinting that they are going to war against the government but however, no third film has been released and to this day, people who are fans of the films (which probably consists of teenagers) are demanding for one in the comment sections despite everyone (especially the director Michael Gallagher) moving on to better things (while Logan Paul gets into more controversy).  I'm just wondering on what people's thoughts on them (if anyone remembers at all)."

The plot and script is interesting and unique with twists and symbolism so well done it definitely warrants a rewatch. Its direction and cinematography rocks, providing a neo-noir look.

One of the things Rian Johnson mentioned was that bad guys were not allowed to use Apple product placement. Johnson couldn't show his villain using an iPhone in *Knives Out*, although there was a tongue-in-cheek reference to this rule in *Glass Onion*.  The rule seems stupid to me. Lots of villains tend to have expensive, luxurious things. I would fully expect Hans Gruber from *Die Hard* to have a much more expensive stuff than John McClane. Gruber wears an extremely nice suit, and McClane spends most of the movie in a cheap-looking tank top. Its part of McClane's character that he is insecure that his wife's career is much more successful than his own.  I bet some watch company paid a lot of money to get Alan Rickman to wear their watch, and that it turned out to be a sensible marketing decision, because rich people would be very happy to own Hans Gruber's watch.  &#x200B;  Do you think that you would be more, or less willing to buy something that was used by a rich baddie compared to a working-class hero? What if both hero and villain were both expected to have ridiculously expensive and beautiful things? Like in a Bond movie."

Warrior (2010)  Of all the Fighting Movies I've ever seen (including Rocky) this is absolutely the best. Honest brotherly termoil has never been done better and it is the first movie in my adult life to let me cry  2. Rocky/Rambo (1976/1982)  If I thought I was wrong about Jim Carrey, holy cow was I wrong about Sly. He puts in phenomenal performances which carry both movies. I know it was bashed at the time but Rambo's breakdown about the hardships of being a soldier is absolutely brilliant. Rocky surprised me quite a bit by being surprisingly actionless, and fantastic for it (its sequels do not carry this quality). Rocky himself might be one of my favourite protagonists in movie history.  3. Eternal Sunshine/Truman Show (2004/1994)  I somehow haven't seen many Jim Carrey movies. These two were both great though. High concept feel good movies that'd deserve all the praise they get.  4. Burn (2019)  I shouldn't love this movie as much as I do but the story of a lowly robber getting kidnapped by a girl incel is just fun. The location is fantastic as well, love one location films  5. Murder on Orient Express (2017)  I watched a lot of murder mysteries recently, and while Glass Onion, Death On The Nile and See How They Run are all good none of them beat This beautifully picturesque murder mystery.  6. Bullet Train (2022)  This is one of the funniest action movies I've ever seen. Nuf said  7. The Batman/Spiderman No Way Home (2022)  Of the two big comic movies I watched this year, I probably preferred The Batman (I'm a Batman fan, sue me). I did enjoy both though and they both seemed to try harder than a lot of other recent comic movies  8. No Child Of Mine (1997) (technically a mini series but who's counting)  An absolutely heart wrenching story about a young girl repeatedly abused by people who are supposed to protect her which is based on a true story. I bring the plot up because the acting of the lead actress is the greatest piece of child acting I've ever seen and I would highly recommend to anyone looking to go on an emotional journey    9. The Big Sleep (1946)  As far as very old movies, this is the one I watched and loved the most. Still holds up for the dialogue alone. No wonder it was such an inspiration  10. Jungleland (2019)  I think I'm a Charlie Hunnam Stan. This movie was like watching a funeral. Still thought it was great. Also BKB is badass  Also I watched through Snyder's filmography and it was passable"

I didn't like the direction of  the major studios are going since everyone is  either leeching off of IP's more than ever, dumping mid budget films to streaming and  some of the original films that did get made and released to theaters a majority of them felt like it's doing the same old things that movies in the the last 50 years have done better.

Holy shit am i sure glad we are somewhat of an obscene family and watch a lot of movies together. There were probably about a total of 25 people in the theater, to begin. About thirty minutes in i ran to the bathroom and as i came out there was a family that had been in the theater with us that decided to leave, it was maybe 3 middle aged women, an older woman, two young children and a middle aged guy. i overhead the oldest woman say “i knew it was gonna be rated R but i had no idea it was going to be that explicit”. okay miss lady why are you bringing kids under the age of 10 to a rated R movie and expecting to to not be explicit? got a good hoot out of me. mind you i'm sure after the split second scene of an elephants asshole opening up really sent them on their way. Went back in the theater and endured the most boobs i have ever seen on christmas. the women sitting in front of me were visibly and audibly grossed out whenever a same-sex kiss was shared on screen and whined to their husbands. The crowds reaction really got me because it was so integral to the experience of the film.   The film itself had me laughing nonstop at some points. it was really crude humor but i like that stuff. the plot was kind of messy and i didn't really like Nellie's character arc just because i felt like we missed so much of it. Tobey's character was fucking horrifying, but he did a great job. the whole sequence in LA's asshole was deeeply disturbing. Manny was an interesting character i just wish that they would have made him less main-character trope-y. Mr. Conrad was a great representation of big star hollywood in my opinion, i think it was somewhat direct satire of leo, johnny, george, that lot. the last thirty minutes of the film felt sooo unnecessary. the climax had already happened and it was just about reiterating a point that films live forever.   overall, there was zero moments of peace in this movie, it's just go go go and everlasting clusterfuck of chaos. although i wasn't bored i can't quite argue that i was entertained. 6/10 wouldn't watch again."

Star Wars Special Editions), or add to an already great story (ex. LoTR).  Never have I seen such a significant quality gap in storytelling between the 2 versions of Kingdom of Heaven.

        "body": "The Edge of Tomorrow (or Live, Die, Repeat) has a plot hole relating to the rules of the movie's time travel and who remembers the details of the previous alternate timeline. A recent discussion on r/movies of major plot holes reminded me of this, and I've never seen it brought up here. Perhaps I'm overthinking a dumb but fun action movie (with an admittedly interesting premise) but it always bothered me.   For those who need a refresher of the plot, the movie revolves around an alien invasion of Earth. The aliens have humanity on the brink of defeat until Tom Cruise's character gains access to the aliens' secret weapon; time-travel. Due to the protagonist getting alien blood in a wound, any time that Tom Cruise's character dies, time rewinds to a set point the prior day. Cruise's character still possess all memory of his prior life, allowing him to reattempt the same challenges with more and more practice. Importantly, no other character is aware of the rewinding of time. In other words, the protagonist effectively has a video game checkpoint with infinite lives.   The plot hole arrives with the introduction of Emily Blunt's character, who like the protagonist, also had the groundhog day-esque checkpoint. I specifically say had, as she claims to have lost her check point ability due to a blood-transfusion she received after a battle.   However, her knowing this information doesn't make any sense. The only way for a character to know if they have this checkpoint is to die, and subsequently experience time-rewinding. So if she lost her ability, she would just die expecting for time to rewind, and then that wouldn't happen. Plus, per the movies rules, she would have no recollection of the previous attempts and rewinds. Later in the film, she even gets frustrated that the protagonist is using his attempts to also try to seduce her, without her knowledge. So to her knowledge, she would believe she still has the ability and wouldn't be weary about blood transfusions (another plot point). Admittedly, I believe the protagonist could inform her that she lost her ability but to my recollection, this isn't done in the film.   Let me know if there is a deleted scene that explains this away or if there are any holes in my logic here. However, this plot hole did somewhat bother me even though Emily Blunt's character obviously also serves to deliver exposition about the movie's universe. I know it's pretty nit-picky, but I thought I'd share regardless.  **TLDR: In Edge of Tomorrow, Emily Blunt's character wouldn't know she lost her checkpoint ability. She would just die with the expectation of respawning.**"

In contrast, in the other timeline, her life doesn't become something extraordinary and is you could say somewhat ruined (though, there is the little wink towards the audience at the end with James and Hellen in the hospital elevator, so maybe that's like a hint that she too will developed a relationship with James or something and then her life will also be good or idk, this movie is a tad bit confusing... especially with Gwyneth's terrible British accent...), but at least she remained bloody alive!  Now, In the timeline where she gets to the train, she doesn't really get to the train. She just barely gets to the doors closing shut but she's able to hold them with her hands and open them up with her hands so that she gets in the train.  Now, that's not a safe thing to do. It is commonly mentioned in train stations through one way or another to not mess with the doors of the train when they are closing. I mean, you probably can, it's just not that safe...  Sooooooo, Since Helen did the mentioned unsafe act in the timeline where she died at the end of the film and she didn't do it in the one where she lives, it'd be quite humorous if there was suddenly at the end of the film the logo of the London Underground with a message telling the viewers not to mess with closing train doors..."

His mother had cancer and was laying in the hospital. I remember him having dreams or visions of his mother being in a hospital on the beach(?) with a crab as a logo for the hospital. I guess that's where he wanted to send his mother to for treatment, but he needed money. For the money he had to kill someone, wich he eventually did.  Also he met a woman he started dating, but they also didn't talk much together on dates. They just spend time together in the cinema or drank a coffee. In the last scene of the movie he was in the cinema and all those people he met in the movie were also there who talked to him (just another vision or dream or whatever i guess)  &#x200B;  Does anyone recognise this movie?

I did not connect or relate to any of the characters as I felt the daughter character went through similar tropes to all girls in coming of age films, (wanting to grow up quicker, desiring romantic intimacy with other people her age, not quite grasping adult issues but knowing they exist) and I feel as if her arc progresses in a predictable manner. More importantly however, I feel as if the dad is a genuinely unlikable character. I hated how petty, childish, and openly resentful he was to having a daughter so young. He did a terrible job hiding his issues with his daughter and instead of better emphasizing with his daughter and making her feel loved, he continued to wallow in his self pity and abandoned her altogether. I read that it's implied that he killed himself but that doesn't make sense to me because I'm sure she would know her dad is dead or at least has disappeared from the face of the earth after that trip. Regardless, I don't feel sympathy for him. I myself struggle with massive depression but I could never walk away from my responsibilities as a parent to a daughter I don't even live with. Oh woe is me you're broke, most parents are! That doesn't give you the right to walk away. And the ending suggesting Sophie understands where her father is coming from is upsetting. He doesn't deserve forgiveness for abandoning a daughter that desperately needed her father's approval. Honestly, I think the biggest issue I had with the film was how formulaic it felt. In no instance did I feel like these events could actually transpire in real life, and it instead felt like some pretentious artsy film a failing NYU grad student would make to boost their grade. I much prefer a movie like the Whale, where all the characters are flawed but have depth and complex reasonings to their actions, that allows you to grow a connection to the characters. As cheesy as that film can be at times, there's an emotional core that's missing from Aftersun.  I understand I'm in the minority here, but I would love to read other's opinions and interpretations so I can better understand what people love about this film."

I'm a huge fan of horror films, so I was super disappointed. However, I keep seeing excellent reviews and everyone I've talked to (aside from the people I went to see it with) seems to love it. I'm considering rewatching it to see if I just missed something the first time, but I'd love some opinions on why people seem to love it so much or what I should look out for / pay more attention to if I watch it again.  P.S. I'm not trying to hate on anyone who likes the movie, I just am curious as to what people like about it. Apologies for any grammatical errors."

For those who are unaware, he voiced Santa Claus in a good majority of the old Rankin/Bass specials, most notably in Santa Claus is Coming to Town, The Year Without A Santa Claus, and Rudolph's Shiny New Year.  I think there's just something about the warmth in the way that he speaks that fits Santa Claus in a way no other actor has replicated. That's why he's my personal favorite."

The character is well written but Saiorse's performance makes it so much likeable and hilarious that I can't remember any other female character that has made me laugh so much.

For the record, the highest ranked movie was Lady in the Water, and aside from Shyamalans self indulgent need to always include and purport himself as somewhat heroic or “misunderstood”, I liked it. I wanted a sequel where they showed her home! Don't judge me , it's not part of the question.  EDIT: I live in the US - I'm noticing it's more common here than in other countries. Not surprising."

        "body": "I've just been watching Matilda the Musical on Netflix and thinking how well produced, delightful it is and how wonderfully Tim Minchin-esque the songs are - and I basically thought Roald Dahl probably would have hated this.  Now Dahl is known as a curmudgeonly old git - which would be endearing (and probably why his books are so good and darkly humorous) if it wasn't for the fact he was an anti-semite, which is heartbreaking when his children's books are so funny, touching and generally have an inspiring message - especially Matilda. Anyway, putting this knowledge to one side, I can't help sympathising with the reasons he hates some of his most well-known adaptations of his children's stories.  There's a dark British edge running through his stories. His adult stories, which are unashamedly dark and sinister, were made into Roald Dahl's Tales of the Unexpected (1979-88) which he had a lot of involvement in. They were straight adaptions of his works. So I can see why he would have admired them.  Now his children's stories were totally different kettle of fish.   Willy Wonka & The Chocolate Factory (1971) is a beloved film. It came out at an era when musicals were popular so unsurprisingly it was a musical.  I can understood why Dahl would have hated it. It's not a straight adaption of his work.   It's Americanized - Dahl wanted UK national treasure Spike Milligan to play Wonka, which I think many of his can agree could have been an equally exceptional portrayal as Gene Wilder's take on the character. The title is changed and more emphasis is out on Wonka over Charlie. Plus, Dahl hated the songs which he called saccharine, sappy and sentimental.   Plus, plot changes are made. After Dahl's death, his second wife said: they always want to change a book's storyline. What makes Hollywood think children want the endings changed for a film, when they accept it in a book?  She's got a point.  For him, the film must have felt like a butchering of one of his greatest works.   Now with the 1990 adaption of The Witches, Dahl disliked the film, and regarded it as utterly appalling and although he praised Huston's performance as the Grand High Witch, he was critical of the ending that contrasted with his book. >!This is in reference to the main character, who is turned into a mouse, being turned back into a boy at the end in the film. In the book, he remains a mouse.!<   Now I happen to think this ending ruins one of Dahl's most deliciously dark and haunting endings. It completely revises that tale for probably most of the children who would have experienced it, I can see why he would have gone berserk over it. Plus, it's effectively the film heads telling probably the most respected and popular children's authors of all time that his endings didn't work for children - which leaves a cold taste  in the mouth.  Now one adaption he did apparently like was the animated film The BFG (1989). It's a very straight adaption of his work. The only straight adaption of his lifetime.   He died in 1990. His widow said he would have loved Henry Sellick's James and the Giant Peach (1996) - which I find quite interesting since it instills that dark comical tone of Dahl's writing.  So do we agree?  Does anyone have more stories to tell about Dahl?"

Let me explain why. *Spoilers alert*  So, Patrick murders a guy - albeit a child abuser - and washes away his internalised guilt and sin by admitting it was wrong and saying he wouldn't do it again. In this case, for Patrick at least, breaking the law is something one should be able to get away with.   Now, this isn't a debate about whether the child abuser should have been able to live or not. Just remember that in Patrick's world, the only right way is his way. Of course, he doesn't turn himself in. Why would he? He apologised to himself and the Lord so he's fine with that.  As the plot develops, it turns out the missing girl is alive and well. She's been taken in a plot by the girl's uncle and the police to remove her from her drug addict mother. Now, Patrick was right - they should have called social services. But they didn't.   Despite Patrick seeing how happy the girl is, how happy the police officer looking after her is (his daughter was killed so this intervention/kidnapping is personal on a deep level of wanting to help the girl) and his girlfriend begging him not to call the authorities - what does ol' Patrick go and do?   Well, in Patrick's mind there even being a slim chance that the girl's drug addict mother can change her ways means they must return the girl. But, let's be honest - in the real world it's wishful thinking. The sensible and rational thing to do would be to leave everything as is and walk away. But not for Patrick, oh no.  The guy who just murdered someone is now oh so holier than thou. He is the arbiter of justice and moral standing. So, taking a huge gamble on the girl's future, he calls the police and that's that. For me, the wild arrogance of this guy is unbearable. To get that far into a movie and see the protagonist turn out to be such a POS is infuriating.   What's even more annoying is that his choice is then validated as the girl's mother goes clean from drugs. But it was a gamble and perfectly encapsulates how he frivolously plays around with people's lives depending on which way the wind blows. Yeah, his girlfriend leaves him - thank god. But, this guy is such an odious douchebag for me at this point I half wanted him to get murdered by one of guys he upset in a bar at the beginning."

I am looking for films where the main protagonist changes their life for the better, only to be struck with some form of tragedy or issue, forcing them to decide whether to fight for what they want or relapse back into their old ways or old life.  Maybe they decided to buckle down and get a good job, but it is made clear very quickly that they really were not prepared for it. Perhaps they overcame drugs or alcohol but then they lost that something or someone that they cared about more than anything else and are now struggling with getting high or drunk again. I am hoping to find both instances: they double down and fight harder in spite of the issues and prove they can do it, or they give up and recede back to their old life.   Thank you all for any help you can give me! I need to fill the word count so here is a quote from Shawshank:  “There's not a day goes by I don't feel regret. Not because I'm in here, or because you think I should. I look back on the way I was then: a young, stupid kid who committed that terrible crime. I want to talk to him. I want to try and talk some sense to him, tell him the way things are. But I can't. That kid's long gone and this old man is all that's left. I got to live with that. Rehabilitated? It's just a bullshit word. So you can go and stamp your form, Sonny, and stop wasting my time. Because to tell you the truth, I don't give a shit.”   I love this!

It may be nostalgia, but I remember loving this one along with Jurassic Park, independence Day and heck Space Jam?   I had, however, never watched 2 and 3. I remember 2 being pretty hyped up and talked about but never actually had the time to catch it. It's ehm a pretty weird movie, feels very much like something more for the kids rather than for everyone, I didn't like it honestly, Will's rap at the end was pretty solid though.  I wanted to talk about 3 though. I found it really good? i was expecting stuff to just get worse from 2 on out but if 1 is an 8 and 2 is a 5.5-6 I'd say 3 is a solid 7-7.5 imo. I was wondering why no one talks about this movie?  As for International, well I'm in the middle of watching it and wanted to write this while stuff was still fresh in my mind. MiBI is weird, I had a feeling it was going to be so when I first saw that they switched the penis guns for a more human designed gun. In so far it's really bland. Hope it didn't kill the franchise. MiBI could be a really cool tv series concept. Following other agents from around the globe kind of like the kids show.  Anyway what do you guys think about this franchise?"

I feel like the characters and their relationships in The Irishman are better than the ones in Goodfellas, and the story is much more emotionally potent. I know the length is an issue with a lot of people, but I actually liked how long it was. It helped flesh out the characters and their relationships. It is fitting for a story where you're following a character over decades of his life because by the end it genuinely feels like it, and it makes the ending of the film more powerful. My main complaint with the Irishman would be that the cgi isn't always perfect, and that in the scenes where Robert De Niro is supposed to be younger you can tell he is an older man (I think most people will know what specific scene I'm thinking of). However I think the story would not have been as powerful if they had different actors play the characters in their younger years, so those problems are worth it.   Part of the reason why I prefer The Irishman may be due to the fact that I saw the Irishman before I saw Goodfellas. I don't wanna say that the reason people prefer Goodfellas is due to nostalgia (though I feel like that plays a role), but due to the similarity in subject matter of the films I feel like you may resonate more with the one you saw first. I'm curious to see why people prefer Goodfellas, and also if anyone else feels the way I do."

I know that that movie is not a New Year's movie per se, but to me I consider it a New Year's movie because my dad who passed away in December 2021 and I watched that movie together on New Year's. Other than that, I'm trying to figure out what other movies I should add to my list and I appreciate all the recommendations in advance, thanks!   Also I was thinking of maybe watching all the Karate Kid movies in 4K Blu-ray sometime this week and then binge watching The Cobra Kai series. Then I was planning on possibly watching the Back to the Future Trilogy in 4K Blu-ray as well If you guys think that these movies and shows are good to add to the list. Lastly, whatever movies that you recommend me to watch I'll add to my list as well, thanks in advance again!"

And the movies I have seen aren't as highly regarded as Shawshank is, which makes sense as they aren't nearly as good in my opinion.  Last night I watched “300” as well, I didn't enjoy it as much as Shawshank, but I still found it fairly enjoyable, especially as I love action. Because I'm now starting to get into movies, I want to get as many classic movies out of the way as I can. So please, just name at least one classic movie in the comments.  My preferred genre's are action, horror, crime, thriller, drama, anything along those lines.

Both of them get into a physical confrontation, but Tuco storms out without seeking reconciliation with his brother. Furthermore, he hides his personal instability to Blondie, and focuses on the money. We never hear of the brother again in the movie.  I felt that the scenes with the brother were pretty eye-opening to his character, and the fact they put it in without finding a closing to that saga was a little disappointing. Everything about this movie was spot-on except for the brother scenes in my opinion. Could anyone explain why they left in that scene without a proper closure? Thanks!"

A perfect blend of cool action and funny dialogue, never forgetting the amazing chemistry between Chrish Tucker and Jackie Chan, but it only has 51% on rotten tomatoes, and critics elsewhere don't seem to get its beauty.  Movies aren't only about the depth of the characters or the performance, they are mostly about the feeling they generate on the viewer. This is something that the critics often forget. These two movies offer you an hour and a half that you'll never forget! They will take you on a ride that is most of all goofy, but in retrospect something very, very valluable... they made you forget your real life and took you into a world much like yours, but somehow different -as in a dream- and made you laugh and giggle like a schoolboy.

We watched it a couple of days ago and something dawned on me. I asked him “so when someone says something like “yeah it's like Groundhog Day,” what do you think that means?”   He said “I have no idea what that means.” Which is somehow hilarious to me bc it's such a common expression for every day feeling the same or a repetitive experience. And I know I've said it to him in the past and probably other people have too, and like what did he think it meant?!  Anyway, it got me thinking—what are some other common expressions/references from movies that may whoosh over others' heads if they aren't familiar with the movie?  ETA: so it seems like there's different categories of things going on in the comments and I'm trying to parse out what separates what I'm asking about from oft-quoted movies.   - I'm starting to think the expression almost has to contain part or all of the title of the movie.  - The expression would be meaningless (or mean something completely different) without the existence of the movie. - the expression basically uses the movie to apply a label to a concept? This might be too specific, not sure.   Some good examples from the comments: - Calling someone a “stepford wife” (yes, source material is a book but I would say it's the case with most movies and I doubt people were using this phrase as commonly before the movie(s)) - adding “ception” to the end of any word when you're talking about a thing within a thing (even though it was correctly pointed out, that's not really what inception means in the movie 😂)  The Bucket List is good too, but a little different to me. I had no idea that the 2007 movie was the origination of the phrase! I never saw the movie but absolutely know what it means and do not associate the phrase with a movie. Because the title itself is a literal common expression and the meaning of the expression comes from the words in the title. Whereas Groundhog Day and Stepford wife don't give much to go on as far as interpreting the meaning unless you saw the movie."

Nicholas Hooper scored Order of Phoenix and HBP while creating excellent scores like Dumbledores funeral and Harry and Hermonie,   My personal favourite is Alexandre Desplat who created a dark and gloomy atmosphere with his brilliant scores. Statues, Courtyard Apocalypse, Snape to Malfoy Manner and Obliviate are some of my favorites."

        "body": "Not necessarily which movies are technically “the best”, but the ones you enjoyed the most.  For me the list would be:  - The Menu  Probably the best fictional single-handed takedown of an entire industry I've ever seen put to screen, and also one of the most interesting entries in the now-popular “class warfare” genre. There are no heroes in this movie, and it's all the better for it. Ralph Fiennes is fiendish as a villainous chef, and his idiot customers provide a generous helping of comic relief to what would otherwise be a quite dark movie.  - Bullet Train  Dumb action made smart, with a meticulously planned clockwork plot and one of the best ensemble casts of the year. Joey King once again proves how underrated she is as she plays a hatable villain with ease, and the celebrity cameos are impeccable. This is a movie that demands to be rewatched over and over, with the promise of finding a new, fun detail in it every time.  - The Whale  A powerful movie about trying to do the right thing and doing the exact wrong thing in the process. Darren Aronofsky manages to create an Uncut Gems level of anxiety inside a single, tiny apartment. A lot has been said about Brendan Fraser's stellar performance, but all the other main actors are just as stunning.  - Guillermo Del Toro's Pinocchio  The best animated film in a very, very, VERY long time. Del Toro outdoes every other version of the classic story by leagues as he makes bold, ridiculous changes to the text that would be laughed off in anyone else's hands but become transcendent within his, complicating the story's moral fabric and giving it new life.   - All Quiet On The Western Front  This film wants to make you angry, and it succeeds in spades. The pain and random death of ordinary soldiers on the front lines of WWI, history's most stupid, useless war, is brilliantly contrasted with the thumb-twiddling negotiations of privileged generals and diplomats more concerned with screwing each other over than ending the suffering.   - Nope  Jordan Peele returns in force with a meditation on the pursuit of fame and its consequences that's one part sci-fi, one part horror, and one part Greater L.A. legend. Steven Yeun steals the show with an unforgettable supporting arc that may be even more compelling than the main story.  - Elvis  Just like its namesake, this spot-on biopic is gaudy, theatrical, and full of thematic contradictions. Austin Butler gives a performance for the ages as he probes deep into The King's psyche to explore the vision that motivated him and the glaring flaws that led to his downfall. The film seems to never exhaust its supply of clever ways to underscore the sheer scope of Elvis's legacy, even as we see the man himself doubt it.  - Turning Red  One of the few big risks Pixar has taken in recent years, this film pays off. It's been a long time since Disney animated movies have had anything new to say about family relationships, but a transition of focus to the more strictly ordered structure of traditional Asian families allows director Domee Shi to explore interesting ideas about what parents and children owe to each other, and what they can learn from one another.  - The Batman  There have been many iterations of Batman over the years, but Matt Reeves gives us a new one: a Batman who's just plain wrong sometimes. As Robert Pattinson's Bruce Wayne tracks down Paul Dano's cleverly modernized Riddler (now an anti-government terrorist doing active recruitment on Reddit), he's forced to confront the numerous similarities between himself and the villains he fights. This may be the only movie ever where Batman decides to change for the better near the end, and that's not a bad thing in our broken age.  - X  Ti West gleefully takes a chainsaw to the erotic thriller in a movie so lowbrow that it's impossible to explain how it's still somehow high art to someone who's never seen it. Mia Goth excels in a dual role as a young, pretty woman and an old, homely one whose twisted obsession with the former drives the film's plot. The supporting cast is just fun, with Kid Cudi, Jenna Ortega, and more getting picked off one by one in a southern gothic-horror equivalent to “Home Alone”.   So there's my picks. All in all this was an incredible year in film, and I'm excited to see different movies pop up on everyone's list."

As I've gotten older, though, I've gained a major appreciation for it. So much so that I felt the need to post this.   I know it's not exactly a hot take to say this, but the movie is very well done and is such a nice, feels good, Christmas movie.   As a kid, the constant narration, 40s time frame, and slow pace put me off. I couldn't understand why mom and dad played it every year. Why watch that when we could watch Jim Carrey's Grinch? I'm sure I often thought. Now, though, as a 23 year old, I get it (I have for the past few years but just now making the post). The older I get, the more I appreciate more of the movie.   This year was the first year I really thought about how sweet it is that Alfie's dad bought him the bb gun. The joy and excitement on the dads face when Alfie is going to the present looks so real. All movie, everyone told Alfie he didn't need the gun and that he'd shoot his eye out, but that didn't stop the dad. He wanted to see his kid's face light up on Christmas.   The movie is FULL of memorable and quotable moments. Between You'll shoot your eye out, Fra-gee-lay, and fa ra Ra Ra Ra you'll surely get some laughter or feels out of it. I've even gotten to where I appreciate the narration style storytelling.   The movie is just chock full of Christmas good time moments and is truly a Christmas classic.  Edit: lmao I literally just watched the damn thing and already forgot the kids name. Ralphie 🤦🤦"

It wasn't really groundbreaking in terms of visuals for its time, but what captivated me the most about this movie was how beautifully the plot unveiled as an emotional rollercoaster. You've got Roger with his Pongo who meets and later marries Anita who's got her Perdita, then Pongo and Perdita themselves form a love union. Then you have the antagonist Cruella, who by the way is so explicitly well portrayed, who's the polar opposite of the protagonists, that creates this incredible good vs. evil story. The comedy, the funny dialogue, the soundtrack, and of course the voices are some other reasons why I like this version of the movie the best.      To preface, I've seen the live action movie from 1996 and quite frankly it didn't capture the same vibes as the original. I could be biased, but it seemed more watered down, almost as if Disney were forcing it to be more children appealing. Idk, do you agree? If no, why?"

The deaths are outstanding and the twist ending I thought was very well done. I do think the direction lagged a bit.

But I was wondering whether the theme of not understanding or even misunderstanding each other (portrayed through the language barrier) also played a role in this. Just think of the scene with the cat, where Jang (or rather the transcription of his recording) misinterpreted 'heart' as 'head'. Could it be that the Korean voice message, especially the passage Song keeps skipping to, has also a similarity to something that expresses love in Chinese? If not literally, then maybe allegorically or regarding the imagery? For me, this topic of misunderstanding / the troubles of communication are so omnipresent in this movie that I was sure it had to be in this scene somewhere, too, but sadly I neither speak Korean nor Chinese, so I can't really look at the text itself."

I'm not bashing either both are amazing just felt it was interesting the duality of two successful filmmakers.  Edit: I should've worded this better and not like it's a fact and exactly how their filmmaking and philosophy is. I mainly wanted to see what the users here thought of it and discussion around it. I watch a lot of movies but will not pretend to understand many, if any, of the different factors they are considering in the process of creation. Also my favorite movies from both of them are Memento and Aliens.  Edit2: I'm also not trying to imply that fans of James are inherently dumber or Nolan fans are pseudo-intellectuals.  Edit3: I've read a lot of these and they've swayed my opinion on this a lot. I initially hadn't considered just how much Nolan spends on explaining the concepts as him treating the audience as stupid and I agree that would go against my initial post. I was originally considering the fact that he does use concepts that need such long explanations to flesh out as him overestimating the audiences intelligence to follow his lead, which could just be chalked up to a flaw in his writing. And to clarify I know Cameron doesn't shy away from complex themes either like colonialism and environmentalism it's just in my mind more accessible for people to understand than the references Nolan is going for that have to be outright taught - Cameron doesn't have to be as heavy handed with explanations and the movie is still enjoyable and digestible if you don't understand something or miss it.   Seems the main thing people here have been able to agree on is instead Nolan overestimates his own intelligence.   Also I forgot Nolan did the Dark Knight series I know that doesn't fit my original post at all!"

I have yet to see a funnier Christmas film than Bad Santa. Billy Bob Thornton, Tony Cox and Bernie Mac were superb in this film and so was Terry Zwigoff, the director. I think the kid was very good as well but the true Superstar of the film was John Ritter who has never funnier than in this film and I don't say it lightly. John Ritter is so good that I started laughing even when appeared on the screen after first 2 scenes.

The zooming-in of the camera, and the shots from a distant angle, makes the movie look vivid. The animation was also top-notch and the weather perfectly reflects the tone of the movie.

Here are my thoughts.  Early in the film her father says he told Trunchbull to give her harsher punishment. understandably most parents would not allow this but a parent saying she can go extra harsh, means she can go extra brutal.  Throughout the film she doesnt develop her powers until after her encounter with the Trunchbull. (Where she is exploding bombs or mines.)  We know that Matilda loves reading and is very creative in her stories.  There is a lasting memory of Bruce trying to move a can with his mind, we know that Matilda uses her experiences in her story that she tells to the librarian.  When we see her in the clouds she talks about people not being able to reach her and I think there was something else.  Throughout the film we see bits that state something like it's not always a happy ending.  Metaphorically, the chains that bind Trunchbull at the end are the police, but she somehow gets away, maybe saying she evaded the law?  The chokey resembles a coffin in the middle of nowhere that Matilda breaks like she is fighting death? At the end she reveals plenty more like she had a plan to kill all of the children, but Matilda's story shows how she stops her and destroys them all, like the consequence of her death mesnt she went too far this time and there was an investigstion.  At the end of the film she releases the glue from her fathers hst, like she has finally let go.  I think there were a few more things but i cant for the life of me remember. Its released tomorrow on Netflix so if you give it a watch again let me know what you think.  All in all I loved the film and I think if this theory was intentional, its a masteroiece if story-telling.  My daughter can't wait to watch it again tomorrow.

Probably because he was the one who revolutionized the cinema history by founding the genre 'space opera' together with George Lucas. However, there are musicians who made exceptional jobs like howard shore or hans zimmer(this one is probably the closest to the geniality of willians) that for some people are more remarkable than willians.

        "body": "I just rewatched the original Black Christmas (1974) the other night, and am curious about what people think happens to Jess Bradford in the end? We know she's in the house alone with Billy (the killer) and it's strongly implied that he goes downstairs at the end of the film, potentially murders Jess, and makes one more phone call, however, Jess's fate is left intentionally ambiguous. Upon multiple rewatches I think the film leans into the idea that Billy murders Jess since he makes a phone call after every kill, but nonetheless it's still left up to interpretation.  Personally I like to think that Jess somehow survived or wasn't attacked by Billy - it could be the way the last scene is edited but it seems like there's way too little time between Billy's descent from the attic and his phone call for him to kill Jess and get to the phone. Also, it's pretty well established that Billy is severely mentally unstable, but it seems odd even for him that he'd call the house after killing Jess knowing it was empty and that no one would pick up, except for maybe the policeman outside?  I think its because the film wants us to sympathize with Jess that I want her to survive, but I still can't make up my mind as to what happens. So what do you think - does Jess survive or is she ultimately another one of Billy's victims? Would love to hear your thoughts about the ending as well as some of the films other ambiguities!

While I understood why all those movies were considered disturbing in their own ways, none of them really ever gave me that sense of “wtf” that you feel deep in your gut when something really disturbing genuinely effects you.   Well, let me tell you, that all changed today when I watched Threads.   It is a film depicting a nuclear apocalypse in British and the aftermaths of it and I have never seen such a disturbing film. It gave me that guy feeling. It's one of those films where, after it was over, I had to just sit in silence for like 10 minutes to just to take it all in and process it.  More importantly than it just being incredibly disturbing and effecting, is that it is GENUINELY aa fantastic movie. I feel like a lot of times when people suggest a movie they consider “disturbing,” it will be a film that relies on shock factor. I've seen a lot of disturbing movies that completely neglect storyline and artistry in lieu of just trying to make the viewer “uncomfortable.” This usually takes away from the emotional effectiveness for me.  When I say “disturbing” or “unsettling,” I mean I want a film I feel like I HAVE to sit with afterwards because it effected me so deeply. Threads is this movie for me.   So if you are like me and are looking for a movie that is not only genuinely disturbing, but also fantastically directed with a unique, enthralling storyline: watch Threads"

My point is that we always retell our Christmas movie stories, but there doesn't seem to be any ones made as of late to continue those memories. A Christmas Story Christmas could have been one, because it was a sequel to a classic. Instead, it was on Peacock.  I see Hallmark and other networks producing new holiday movies, but have the studios done so as of late theatrically? Do you expect there to be another good Christmas movie sometime in the future?"

While your not meant to agree with the points Tyler spouts, I feel it would have been a little more powerful if the film gave the Narrator an alternative path that he could have gone, but I understand that was not the point.  I saw a post here recently on movies who's subtlety messages are either ignore or not considered by audiences, like Robocop's pro Union and Anti-Capitalist message or It's a Wonderful Life's Socialist message and It made me remember how hard trying to convey a message that people will understand without being as transparent and in your face about it. Doing that would have the film be branded as propaganda by some. I always support film-makers not holding back in their messages but I know many would disagree with me.   How can a filmmaker convey a message in their movies without being accused of making propaganda?  I know many go to films for escape but films (and media in general) believe it or not has been a huge influence in how we progressed as a society so I understand why filmmakers always have a message they to put out there that could spark change."

I personally don't even always understand, or even often understand. That said, I'm tired of seeing every new war movie get labeled as anti-war basically immediately- because it is horrific and harrowing.  Anti-war is not the same thing as “War bad,” everyone knows war is bad, but yet it still happens every day. A True anti-war film IMO gets to the heart of the human condition to discuss and deconstruct what makes us tick, what makes us violent, whether violence is inevitable, etc. As a filmmaker though, you really can't just say war is bad, it's like saying rape is bad and acting all smug and smart about it (cough cough Irreversible cough cough).  Anyways, All Quiet (2022) is a fine movie but a failure as an anti-war piece, and IMO big letdown to the source material.  What are some movies you feel truly convey an Anti-War narrative, not just War is Bad."

In a way, the entire drama of the final act is her fault, completely.   Thank you for coming to my rant. Enjoy your holidays, everyone!"

He gets angry and he gives up, and it makes him feel flawed and down-to-earth. Throughout the movie he learns to appreciate himself and use his weight to his advantage. Kung Fu Panda is loaded with messages about acceptance and self-love. Tai Lung was the perfect warrior, but he was rejected for his evil heart. Po was hardly a warrior at all, but he was accepted for...well, I think it was destiny, but he's also a noble, honorable, kind guy through and through.

How Scar is introduced playing with a helpless mouse he is about to devour while skipping out on his nephew's birth ceremony. When Zazu reprimands Scar (causing him to lose the mouse) he immediately tries to eat Zazu. Already, we know that this guy is Bad News.  Or Aladdin shows himself to not only be an affable thief, but a guy who's soft enough to give his stolen food away to a pair of homeless children without a second thought. The One Jump Ahead song tells you absolutely everything you need to know about the guy in a catchy two-minute package.

I love Christmas movies so I'll name some that are family favorites in my house.   Scrooge (1970) - this is a classic version of A Christmas Carol with original songs. This production benefits from lots of talent carried over from 1968's Oliver! Another classic musical. Not much to say about this one other than it's my family's classic version of A Christmas Carol, it's paint by the numbers, but has good acting and some fun songs.   Arthur Christmas - I have no idea how many people remember this extremely cute movie from 2011 but I adore it. It has trappings of a classic kids Christmas movie where you might expect an evil real estate man trying to destroy Christmas, but no! Nothing like that. In fact I don't know if you could find a Christmas movie where the stakes are lower! In the first 15 minutes of the movie Christmas goes off without a hitch, all the presents delivered, Santa's job is done! Only wait, one child was missed. Just one. What follows is a truly deep dive in my opinion about how the biggest enemy of Christmas isn't an evil cartoon villain, it's forgetting that Christmas isn't about your petty arguments or the glory of who gets to be Santa, or what methods are best, it's about the joy the person you give a gift has.  It's a subtle reminder not to make the holidays about yourself, make it about those you care about.   Klaus 2019 - on Netflix, a surprisingly good and as far as I know completely original new origin for Santa. It got lots of awards, you very well have heard of it, but if you haven't, definitely give it a try.   Spirited 2022 - I doubt this is a hidden gem, but it's new, and I've already watched it 4 times this year lol. Ryan Reynolds and Will Ferrell star in yet another Christmas Carol adaptation, also a musical, with a few really awesome numbers that involve huge casts of dancers. Even if you're tired of A Christmas Carole, I highly recommend checking this one out as it will surprise you a bit here and there as the ghosts find this Christmas goes off the rails a bit. It's on Apple + only I think.   What's your holiday recommendations? Have you seen any of mine?"

The plot is also fascinating: Keanu playing a lawyer who knows his clients are guilty, and yet defending them anyways, unaware of the impending consequences of his actions.   It all leads up to the final showdown of Kevin Lomax and John Milton, and man is it spectacular; Pacino goes more Pacino than any of his other roles. But it loses me towards the end, when Lomax kills himself in the altar(?) which leads to the end of Milton and his half-sister too. Except, it was a different reality all along, as the film foreshadows in the beginning. So Lomax, who arguably is more evil than Milton, gets a second chance. He doesn't have to live with the terrible things he did.  It just wasn't a satisfying ending to me. Here's my alternate ending: Lomax is offered the choice by Milton to inherit the legal empire in exchange for giving him children. Still grieving over Mary Ann's suicide and the reporter's revelation before he was ran over, he decides to go back to Gainesville with his mother and become a good lawyer. Not a happy ending because of his consequences, but he still finds some redemption.   If it weren't for the ending we got, I think The Devil's Advocate could have become a cult classic, even a critically acclaimed film."

I'm sure many of you think I must be crazy or have terrible taste in movies, but let me tell you some of the reasons I love this movie.   I'm a bigger fan of the Resident Evil movie franchise than the game series, having only played a few titles. So I am not bothered by characters not being portrayed like they are in the games, but I'm familiar enough to recognize character names.   This RE entry is directed by Paul W.S. Anderson, his return to the franchise, having directed the 1st but not the 2nd & 3rd. The movie was filmed using 3D cameras, not converted to 3D in post, making for an enjoyable experience for 3D fans. FYI, if you have an Oculus Quest 2, this can be watched in 3D via Vudu.   First, excellent opening sequence with a great soundtrack. Followed by the assault on the Umbrella Tokyo facility by multiple Alices, which is something I just love. The image of over a dozen black clad Alices running around with sub machine guns is one of the best in the series. Great action, especially in 3D, with a very cool depiction of Wesker introduced who spouts ridiculous lines perfectly (“…and I want damage reports”).   The shift from Tokyo to a desolate Pacific North West, then to a zombie filled Los Angeles, provides a good balance and shift in tone. The prison is a perfect setting for a zombie apocalypse scenario.    I'm not a fan of Ali Lartner, but she is okay in this. Wentworth Miller, Kim Coates, Boris Kodjoe and (again) Shawn Roberts as Wesker are fun.  Other highlights include Alice's quarters, the Axeman shower fight, and using A Perfect Circle for the closing sequence.  This is a fun movie that I definitely recommend, especially in 3D."

Where as in the previous films ships had engines , looked dirty and weren't so clean cut. Everything just looks way too shiny and unused. The princesses ship especially looks badly designed.   Also some scenes simply look incredibly cartoony. The battle on naboo looks terrible. All the lighting looks so unrealistic. Something CGI still struggles with today.   These were bad films when they came out and they're just as bad now. They don't continue on the star wars universe that was established in the previous trilogy.   That's my take."

Cities, especially, can create a powerful form of this kind of saudade.  So, what film or show's portrayal of a city would you consider particularly memorable?  P.S. Please be specific. 'Gotham', for example, has been the primary setting of all the versions of Batman, but for me *The Animated Series* Gotham is the one I have the most powerful sense of being 'Gotham'.

I have watched and loved every single one of his movies and they never fail to impress me. Obviously, some are closer to my heart than others but his mastery of the craft and visual inventiveness was always there. To the point where I would always say to everyone: “There's no such thing as a bad Spielberg movie”. Now on to the subject of this posting:  “The Fabelmans” is clearly Spielberg's most personal film as its subject is his childhood, his family moving from New Jersey to Arizona and finally to California to follow his father's successful engineering career. The story is a rather bland straight forward recounting of his parents mariage difficulties and young Spielberg's nascent love of cinema and the craft of making movies. However, The Fabelmans is also Spielberg's most disappointing  movie. It is the least interesting, the least inventive and worst; his least cinematic.  And so, it is with sadness that I have now to admit that there is indeed such a thing as a bad Spielberg movie.  Even a genius moviemaker like Spielberg couldn't disprove the old adage that «Talent is a curve »."

And in the 80s and 90s, you had a host of popular genres like thrillers, sci-fi, action, and so on. In 2000, Gladiator and LOTR enjoyed success and briefly revived the historical/fantasy epic genre.  Almost always, you have a movie or movies that cause the cycle to begin in the first place. Then you have some film(s) failing and therefore ending that genre's domination. e.g. films like Heaven's Gate and One from the Heart led to the demise of the Hollywood new wave.  Currently superhero fanchises (Marvel, DC, and so on) dominate the box office (at least in Hollywood) and seem to be doing pretty well. But at some point, there has to be a film that hypothetically fails and beings an end to this cycle.  What do you think will be the next genre to dominate the box office? And Why?  Feel free to discuss.  EDIT: Personally, I hope the historical/war movie genre will make a comeback someday, but that's probably just wishful thinking (Scott's Napoleon and the Cleopatra remake with Gal Gadot are about to be released/filmed, but whether they're actually successful is another matter).  Apart from that, it would also be great if someone made a western with a large, epic scope like Heaven's Gate (most westerns these days seem to focus on a smaller scope in general)."

I would come back and watch it every few years or maybe even more, so not that much.  However, as an adult, not seeing it for several years now, this movie is a masterpiece, and I would easily put this on my top 10 movies of all time, if not top 5 even.  I was gutwrenched, even with the last two sequels on top of it.  So I would put them in my top 10 as one.  But do other adults find this to be the same for them compared to when they were a kid, or was it me and I was just one of those kids with shallow taste lol?"

Some of it's left out or shifted around a bit, but it is so incredibly true to the source material.  Depp and Del Torro spent months with Thompson doing drugs so they could portray every scene as accurately as possible. Apparently when they did a pre-screening with Hunter he had literal flashbacks during the opening bat scene and he flipped out.  It's also just the pinnacle of iconic drug movies, maybe besides Up In Smoke. Also great to watch on drugs, the camera-work is great. It doesn't compare to the trippy modern CGI you might see in something like Dr. Strange, but they did a fantastic job for mid-90's tech."

The historical pieces of the movie were decent, but i found myself not being able to connect with the characters at all because of how little development was available.  There's a few scenes of the friends talking about how exciting the war is going to be, a morale speech by their recruiters / commanders, the actual march to the battlefield, then they all die quickly, and the MC is left with himself and few others. The most emotionally stressful scenes were that of people dying, a few that the main character had little to no connection to, and from then on the film really just drags.  I was really disappointed by this movie and it could've been done so much better."

A film about such a monotonous subject that is filled to the brim with the youthful conquer-the-world college energy, Sorkin's career best dialogue, beautifully shot and edited in the classic David Fincher fashion, with pitch-perfect casting and performances in a story as old as time: a story of betrayal, theft, ambition and isolation. All relatively based on a true story about the creation of one of the most widely influential and impactful companies in history.  Now, just take a look at what has happened to Mark Zuckerberg and the company since then. This is not a political post, so I'm not sharing an opinion on these, just acknowledging they're things they've had to deal with since 2010 : their role in the Arab Spring, first billion users, Russian election interference/Cambridge Analytica, testifying before Congress, accusations of supporting propaganda involved in genocide, a trillion dollar valuation, rebranding, Metaverse, and possibly a rumored resignation. There is another compelling story about our times to be told in there somewhere.   And another Fincher/Sorkin/Eisenberg would be sure to match much of the key quality of the original. So that instead of getting ripped off the Oscar (you can like The Kings Speech all you want, you won't convince me that it's even remotely a better movie), the Academy can right this wrong. An error that I think has becoming increasingly acknowledged since then, and could also give Fincher an opportunity to finally get his due with an Oscar given his really incredible career"

They have no idea how the characters are going to look, and they need to imagine the entire scenery.  Robin Williams as the Genie in Aladdin (1992), I think comes very close to being the GOAT next to Mel Blanc!! Not only did he manage to give the character so much energy using his voice, he also gave quite an emotional performance when it came to moments that were serious, and most of his lines were ad-libbed.  I also think James Woods as Hades in Hercules (1997) Mark Hamill as the Joker in Batman and Steve Carrell as Hammy in Over the Hedge (2006) are right behind him!"

This is what most people would call “edgy.”  What movie or movies have you guys seen that you'd best describe as edgy?  I think some noteworthy examples could be the entire Human Centipede franchise, the insanely horrible A Serbian Film, and (depending on who you ask) anything by Lars Von Trier. Anything else along those lines?  Edit: Well shit, seems like “edgy” is an insanely subjective term. Donnie Darko's been mentioned like 30 times and so have Fight Club and American Psycho.

Overdone Jewish tropes. Think Eddie Murphy as the barbershop Jew and Larry David just being himself. I wanted to cringe and laugh.    Instead I got what I can only describe as an alien's best attempt at making a Jewish movie. This movie was like someone took For Your consideration's Home for Purim seriously and tried to make it, only during channukah. I would call the movie a shonda (disgrace) but there has to be a modicum of Jewishness to earn that title.   First, almost every Jewish character was blond but more importantly they were boring af. Their complaining and nagging was endearing, not soul shattering like real Jewish grandparents. The story was about latkes but everyone knows that Hanukkah is really about jelly donuts and latkes are just an appetizer.   The kicker is that the two Jewish love interests bond over pennies that they find and pick up off the ground. It's like a Protestant from middle America was asked to write a movie about Jews and this is what he came up with.   10/10 highly recommended (a few drinks is a must)"

The acting and the story were actually pretty good too. The characters were more developed than a typical action movie and I was genuinely surprised in some of the directions the story took. Usually you can predict the plot of an action movie.   Sure there was quite a bit of cheese but that's to be expected. You can only do so much being stuck in one interior location, but I think they really got their mileage out of it (ha!) I also read they shot over COVID so they had to do it all on a sound stage which is even more impressive.   Anyone else like this film? I didn't hear many people talk about it when it was out in theaters."

The conversation at the dinner table between Tess and Danny feels ripped from some old school Cary Grant shit. It's amazing. Not to mention the editing and pacing of the movie, it's more entertaining than the majority of movies I've seen the last few years.  The sequels are definitely a dip on form, they keep the cast chemistry and brilliant soundtracks but they really lose an element the first film had. I'm assuming this is because the screenwriter of 11 was not involved with the other two and the banter is definitely lacking in the sequels compared to original.  However they all have their moments and if they kept things simple, dealt with the cast members that passed away respectfully and fill the gaps they left well I would absolutely love to see another one of these movies."

I'm not the greatest writer with things like this and it's probably going to be very train of thought but here goes…  I grew up in the 2000s and lived through the initial buzz and phenomena of the American Pie movies. I wasn't old enough to actually go see them, but me and my brother would sneakily watch them whenever we could. They had a type of mythos around them for people of my age and revitalised the raunchy comedy genre. We even had films that weren't the same genre marketing themselves as if they were. Some movies even outright stole the logo (Can't Hardly Wait which came out first, but used the exact same logo as AP for subsequent releases).   After the initial three movies that had somewhat diminishing returns, the franchise divulged into yearly straight to dvd releases tethered only by the Stifler name and Eugene Levys wonderful acting. Despite some of these not being that good, they were still kind of big in the sense that the brand never died out. Then 'American Reunion' came out. It was a decent box office success and overall a pretty good film, but for whatever reason we never got a sequel even though one was announced and the cast had even signed onto it.   In the years following that one (it's been over a decade 💀), it has been pretty much crickets. A year or two ago we got a Netflix spin off thing that made ZERO noise whatsoever and I feel like even the original movies have faded into obscurity and have become a forgotten relic of their time.   Where do you think the franchise stands in this current day? Do you think a reboot/remake could happen? Would it even work in this day and age? I recently rewatched and there are a few of them that somewhat stand the test of time (mainly the original, the sequel, reunion and even band camp kind of)."

They had a frickin lore for Santa Claus! A lore that made sense and also explains why he is able to kick such ass. He even has a character arc. It surprised me a lot. The movie had nailed almost every part (a few characters and the last 2 mins nagged me a bit but not much) but honestly no complains.   A major props to action. I thought this would be a fast and furious kinda action - somewhat family friendly and PG at best, but no. I'm glad the filmmakers made the movie so goddamn violent and gory. The movie certainly earned and deserved the title.  David Harbour was amazing! He had no business being that good of a Santa but here we are. Honestly I wouldn't mind watching a sequel for this movie. Alos I would love a prequel explaining Santa's lore because if you watch and for those who have watched know how badass those few glimpses of past were.   Way better than my expectations and surely one of the best action movies of the year that surprisingly has a good story."

I've obviously watched the Disney animated version, and now I've read the book I can see how they've cleverly implemented various parts of the book to create the shortened down version of the story. The recent live action/cgi version tried to replicate it but with alterations that clearly makes it an inferior version. Then I had high hopes for Guillermo Del Toro's new stop-motion version. But having just finished it, I actually think it is unfortunately the furthest from the book. They changed/added so much it's almost a whole new story. In fact I'd go so far to say I won't be watching it again anytime soon as it left me very disappointed.  This leads me to ask has anyone seen other more obscure versions of the tale, and are they closer to the book?

I had a general idea about flying saucers, mystery and perhaps some Jordon Peele-esque allusions to things like filmmaking/sci-fi tropes/etc.   This film made no sense, and almost all of the elements are undercooked and half-baked in my sure-to-be-flamed opinion ;)   Let's start with the obvious flaws:  1. D. Kaluuya - acting was catatonic and truly uninspired. I like this dude, but I wouldn't call this a high point for him AT ALL. His arc in this story also made no sense and random is what I would describe his impact. For some reason lots of people give him the benefit of the doubt here but I'm not seeing it. Could possibly be replaced by pretty much any comparable actor in this role.   2. Steven Yeun's character - probably the most intriguing part of the story, made no sense. And this comes from a Twin Peaks fan who often looks for underlying meaning to subtle plot points and general mood that probably goes nowhere but up a butthole lol. There was lots of slow-zooms and mysterious camera angles but ultimately his arc didn't accomplish anything except be a red herring? Maybe I'm missing something but my general feeling is there were cuts made to his side of the story and it messed up the meaning. Anyone agree? I truly like Yeun as an actor but this just wasn't it.  3. The monkey scenes. I mean, this piqued my curiosity throughout, and I was begging for it to come back round and imbue the film with a underlying message of....something...anything...I'm truly confused about what Peele thought he was communicating here with these vignettes? Once again, maybe I'm missing something so if someone can help, that would be appreciated.  4. The ending: To me, a good ending has to have some level of threat or risk involved. The good guys have to overcome or not overcome a challenge and this leads to a satisfying conclusion (for me personally). However, like other not-so-good films I've seen, this threat is never really present, and the good guys kind of accomplish...something...just in the nick of time? Before what?  5. That saucer: now I know this is a personal subjective thing, but for some reason, the flying cowboy hat with a butthole never truly landed for me...Maybe he was trying to say something about filmmakers being up their own butts? Truly baffling stuff. It kinda ruined my immersion and I think a more traditional saucer would actually have helped since the overt mixing tropes and allusions kind of muddled an already muddled story.  Sorry for the long ramble, I'm truly looking for some discussion around these points in good faith. I realise lots of people liked this film but I wouldn't give this anything higher than The Matrix Resurrections, which was also a truly confusing journey from a filmmaker probably overstretching themselves. Also if I need to censor anything in the post please let me know - trying to be vague as possible for those who haven't seen it."

Aliens has good sci-fi still, but the writing sucks, the aliens look like crap most of the time and the acting is SO cringe except for Lance Henricksen as Bishop. Sigourney Weaver's performance is so corny and never believable, which is weird considering how good she is in Alien. Plus, it's a military, whip out the giant guns movie.

In the chase sequence with the Joker, is cronies take down a police helicopter, and the passenger in the armored car says that's not good twice as it crashes. Yes the 2nd time he precedes it with, 'okay', but in an attempt to add some levity, I guess, it just seems like a bad joke with worse delivery.  What line in a great movie takes you out or frustrates with its delivery?"

It pulls no punches in trying to be what it is.   Ebert in his review described the movie as like Jackie Chan and Buster Keaton meet Quentin Tarantino and Bugs Bunny  and I would have to agree with him on that.  It is kind  a hard movie to describe because it checks so many boxes and in honestly, was lucky to even make its money back.   The movie is wild and with its meager budget, it makes you wonder why so many in Hollywood never swing for the fences and make something truly unique."

I will never stop watching them every year, but I will be adding Home Alone 3 to my annual Christmas movie watch list. The main reason that I think it is better is because it's writing is way better. I never realized until this latest rewatch that Hughes wrote the 3rd movie (and actually didn't write the 2nd).   The story is much more cohesive, and makes way more sense to me. First off, the kid actually tries to call the cops multiple times and only resorts to fending off the criminals himself because nobody listens to him. Second, the villains have an actual reason to keep pursuing the kid because the chip is worth so much. I never understood why Harry and Marv didn't just stop after the second trap, because they could have just left and probably never been caught.  The characters are all just better in general too. Alex is so much more likeable than Kevin, because Kevin is kind of a little monster. He hates his family and is happy they are gone? That is horrendous and abusive. The 3rd movie is centered around a more normal family that I can relate to way more.  To just kind of sum it all up I think Home Alone 3 has less plot holes, more likeable characters, and is generally more entertaining. I've seen negative posts about it before and I think everyone should at least give it a try to decide for yourself."

War movie - soldiers are in trenches and they despise one of their comrades because his dad is a high ranking military official so he gets preferential treatment in the trench. There's a mission where a group of them need to reestablish a communication wire that was severed in no man's land. The privileged soldier's only job is to sound a whistle if he sees enemies advancing on his comrades. He sees enemies but is too scared to whistle so his comrades die while he crawls back and reports to command that he did everything he could. Except, one of the squad members survives the attack, comes back to the trench, and reports that the privileged soldier did not sound the whistle and that's why the mission failed. May have been in black and white 50/50.    .  2. Gangster/mob movie. A crippled mob boss in a wheelchair and his right hand are in a dim workshop interrogating one of the gang members that failed an assignment. While the boss is making the failed member feel like he's ok and forgiven, he asks his right hand to find a pair of scissors. His right finds a small set, mob boss says asks for something bigger. They keep talking. Right hand finds bigger scissors, mob boss says they need even bigger scissors. Mob boss asks failed member what he likes to do - the answer is dance with his wife.

Do they just wake up on christmas morning and think Oh must have been the amazon employee who went thump in the night when they see all the presents under the tree?

'cause while i appreciate the message about overcoming depression and finding self-worth, i can't help but feel it also sends an implicit false message that *every* person brings this dramatically abundant amount of value to the world. and also, i feel like the movie should've chosen a more average person to convey that message, instead of someone who has literally saved people's lives and prevented multiple deaths and tragedies ('cause realistically, most people have never done that).   i know what the movie was trying to do with the message, and while i respect that, i personally think it pushed the boundaries a little too much with how much good things he was responsible for. for example, of *course* if someone saves their brother's life and helps their family have a successful career, that person automatically has a lot of value and purpose by default. but those things, along with other extreme examples of this him existing being the better reality thing, are not even close the lives of the vast majority of people. if you choose an exaggeratedly prolific person in their good deeds, like the protagonist in this movie, of *course* it's gonna be easy to point out why he should've been born and why he shouldn't kill himself. but most people simply are not nearly as important as that and will never be. and that's where i criticize it, 'cause if you're gonna send this message to the viewers, and if you want it to really stick the way you want to, then you must choose a more average, relatable protagonist.  so, overall, do i think it's a wonderful life is a bad movie? no. i still think it's a fairly decent movie in general, despite my mixed feelings. and i'm curious to hear what others think."

For me, I had a prediction for Avatar 2 and the sequels, that maybe they'd explore the idea of there being bad/evil Na'vi, because, well...if there are good and bad humans then it can be assumed there are bad Na'vi as well as good na'vi, and while the Recoms kindof fulfilled that role, it still wasn't what I was expecting, also I don't think they will because that may contradict the themes Cameron wants for the series and what he wants the Na'vi to represent, not too mention, like I said, the Recoms seem to be fulfilling that role in some way.  Another prediction I had that didn't come true is that, well, I thought that that the Spiderman NWH was going have a new post credits scene maybe setting up plot point for Spiderman 4, like maybe have Kingpin running for Mayor, or Revealing Mysterio was still alive and somehow still retains the memories of Peter, or God forbid, Morbius, Vulture, and Aaron Taylor-Johnson Kraven find a way into the MCU, and while there was a new post credits scene, it clearly wasn't any of those.  Finally, the last prediction I had that didn't came true was that Smile was secretly a sequel to Truth or Dare, you know, that stupid Blumhouse Horror movie/film. That prediction was mostly from just seeing the teaser for the first time when I went to go see Top Gun Maverick and not knowing what it was at first, of course was I did more research on it, I quickly found out that prediction clearly can't be true.  TLDR: I had predictions for Avatar 2 and sequels that the story would explore the idea of good and evil Na'vi, but this did not happen. I also predicted that the Spiderman NWH movie would have a post-credits scene setting up a plot point for Spiderman 4, but this did not happen either. Finally, I had thought Smile was secretly a sequel to Truth or Dare, but this was not true either."

I feel guilty every time I watch it, but as I'm laughing at it's romance-whiplash, Rachel McAdams cringe performance, and big dramatic outbursts, I'm also rooting for every character, belly laughing at subtle physical comedy, and moved to tears at least 3 or 4 times.

I had thought the book would be almost impossible to film without rushing through its' many plotlines. But any time I felt that a scene was a little too quick in treatment, the film would suddenly linger patiently on a philosophical point, using innovative filming techniques and powerful Tolstoy language to take you to new heights.

There's definitely some really good elements to Inception, like the loaded cast and acting of course. Using the first half of the movie for world building was also nice. And the visuals and action sequences were great. So it's not bad by any means.  And yet, Inception's plot didn't manage to feel...convincing? Maybe it's because I wasn't really attached to any of the characters emotionally, or the concept of levels of dreams was interesting but not executed well (in my opinion). In the second half, the movie tries to do so much in a short amount of time that I stopped getting heavily invested. I've seen people online saying Inception is enjoyable if it's not taken seriously, which would be fine, but...the movie takes itself seriously by spending so much time on world building that I feel like I should try to oblige.   Inception already feels outdated as a mind-bending movie, which is disappointing because of how critically acclaimed it is. The Prestige, Nolan's work that came out 4 years earlier, has aged much better in my opinion. Maybe because it has a much simpler presentation that constantly convinces and hooks the viewer."

I wouldn't necessarily ask for a Sam Elliott or a John Wayne type that would just turn the movie into a caricature of itself and I am guessing director Jane Campion wanted avoid that partly by casting him for the role but I think it was too far out of the expectations which made him stick out in a bad way.

Now, my personal favorites are scores that I consider 10/10: they have enhanced the cinematic experience by elevating the films they were  written for to new heights, and both integrate perfectly into the film as well as stand out as a stand-alone listening experience.  **Babylon**, Justin Hurwitz.  Amazing film, amazing score, I've had it on repeat  since the day the score was released.  Lovely style throughout, killer melodies, incredibly in-your-face in the best of ways.  **Glass Onion**, Nathan Johnson.  Also an amazing film with an amazing score.  The  score fit perfectly, was allowed to really be a character in the film, and I love the overall classic-hollywood-murder-mystery style that was allowed to be really prominent.  **All Quiet on the Western Front**,   Volker Bertelmann.  A surprising stand out film and score for me; it's an utterly visceral film that I think everyone should watch.  The  score legitimately gave me goosebumps a few times, and really added to the viewing experience.  And it makes me feel all sorts of things listening to it on its own.  **Station 11**, Dan Romer.  Beautiful show with a beautiful & eclectic score.  The show came out end of '21 but the score wasn't released until '22, so I'm counting it as a 2022 score release.  The stand out tracks make me want to sit and weep because things are beautiful and heartbreaking at  the same  time.  **House of the Dragon**,  Ramin Djawadi.  One of the few elements that maintained quality throughout GOT was Djawadi's score, and his work on HOTD did not disappoint.  I loved the show and loved the score more.     The  following scores are 10/10's in that they were utterly fantastic in the  context of the films they were written for, but are not ones I've actively sought out or felt was a great listening experience on their  own (though that's certainly subject to change!):  **The Banshees of Inisherin** by Carter Burwell, **Bones and All** by Reznor/Ross, **Everything Everywhere All at Once** by Son Lux, **Where the Crawdads Sing** by Mychael Danna, **Nope** by Michael Abels, **Top Gun Maverick** by Zimmer/Balfe/Faltermeyer/Gaga, **The Batman** by Michael Giacchino, and **Andor** by Nicholas Britell.     And then scores that I generally liked but have some form of a caveat, keeping them out of my favorites for the year:  **Prey**, Sarah Schachner.  This one ALMOST made it to my personal favorites but not quite.  Phenomenal score for a surprisingly great movie with a few  stand out tracks, would highly recommend anyone see it who has not.  **Kenobi**, John Williams.  The main theme was great, but that's the only thing I really enjoyed.  **The Rings of Power**, Bear McCreary.  There's parts I liked and it generally fit the show well, but it somehow lacked heart and isn't something I've enjoyed by itself.  **Black Panther Wakanda Forever**, Ludwig Göransson.  Solid score, some really dope added elements with the Mayan materials, but as a whole I didn't love the score as much as I would have liked.  **Turning Red**, Ludwig Göransson.  I've only heard a few tracks from it and have not seen the movie but WOW those few tracks are perfect.  **Kimi**, Cliff Martinez.  A bit of a departure from what I'm used to hearing Martinez do, but I liked it in the film!  **Women Talking,**   Hildur Guðnadóttir.  I haven't seen the movie yet and have only heard parts of the score, but the parts I've heard are great and, like Martinez, a departure from what I'm used to hearing with her scores.  **Jurassic World Dominion** by Michael Giacchino, **Doctor Strange Mutiverse of Madness** by Danny Elfman, and **Thor Love and Thunder** by Michael Giacchino.  These three were all fine...the scores generally fit the movies well, but there's things I really wished had been changed or done differently, and they ultimately fell a little flat for me even if  there's tracks in them all that I enjoyed.  Apologies for the hugely long and rambling post...I get excited talking about film scoring, clearly.  What scores have you really enjoyed this year?  Are there ones I'm missing that I really need to hear?"

And not just a song they thought sounded cool... lyrics that reference the films. 'Flash' more so, of course, but 'Princes of the Universe' is pretty heavily influenced by Highlander aswell.    So if you originally have these movies at a 6/10... I think the addition of Queen should boost them up to at least an 8/10. Cause to fair, no other film can ever have Queen do their soundtrack. Sure, you can get Brian May to write it... but without Freddie it wouldn't be the same.    Now I'm not here to pretend Queen is everyone's taste... but I think you have to respect the fact that the band only ever did original songs for these two movies. Regardless of reason or circumstances. That makes them unique films. Rare, perhaps?     I will also shout-out Labyrinth whilst I'm here. Not only did David Bowie do every single song... even the baby vocals... but he also acted and helped with the dance choreography in the film. And Freddie and David were both friends. So it's all connected. May they both rest in peace."

Showing the ridiculousness of believing in religion and how they gaslight families into becoming followers to be able to sexually abuse children?  I googled and searched on Reddit but haven't seen anyone really mention this yet as the movie's main intention.  Remember the constant mention of “flocking” — referenced as white snow continued to get sprayed all over the tree.  And how are they going to have her just walk straight into Santa's groin like this, with the next frame showing white snow exploding into the frame?   Or am I just high?  EDIT — I mean, just read these quotes with the context of writers attempting to mock religion..  1. “It's not about logic. It's about magic.” — exactly how religions explain “faith”  2. “Christmas: If you're not on the bus, you're under it.” — Christianity: If you don't believe it, you're - terrible person and going to hell.  3. “Faith may be the last great universal concept holding the whole world together.” — how often is this a theme in religion?"

Sandra Bullock (Annie) and Jason Patric (Alex) severely lacked the chemistry that the Sandra Bullock and Keanu Reeves (Jack) had but Willem Dafoe (Geiger) always plays a good bad-guy and there is enough action, jeopardy and humour to keep you mildly entertained throughout.   I thought the introduction was actually quite good, it showed Annie is still the same loveable goof as from the first film and Alex although not as bad-ass as Jack does have something about him. Fairly quickly after they get on the boat it starts to kick off, straight in to the action which was another positive. It's always nice to see the 'bad-guy' thwarting the 'good-guys' first few attempts at 'saving the day' (admittedly it would be nice if he did more than tap a few keys on a keypad to do it but i get it, he's a hacker) and much like the first one It's not quite as simple as surviving the initial threat.  Admittedly the beginning of the end sequence is pretty interminable, after they narrowly avoid the oil tanker they then proceed with a drawn out, slow collision with a harbour, which felt so unnecessarily long and entirely predictable. I don't know if this was left in to just pad the length of the movie or what but it just feels so anti-climatic.   Ultimately I just think that's its an average film, it doesn't do anything really well and has plenty of flaws but a score of 4% on rotten tomatoes seems harsh."

I feel like he had a moustache, possibly handlebar. I think it then switched to a contemporary time and followed a woman possibly in the same house the man who was hanged had been in. I'm remembering, like, a dormer attic/farm house type house. Then YTV realized the error, cut off the broadcast, and switched to playing Freaky Stories while they sorted it out. I was sufficiently shook (and I never did see Little Rascals).   I wonder if anyone else remembers this and might remember what movie that was?? It's always bothered me!!"

I guess it does make sense that he was sentimental with the lady and why he couldn't teach Salora how to read.   But, his body motion and reaction to everything shows he isn't blind, he is able to see and take a tray from Salora's mom and he looks around places. Elia also is a skilled fighter and hunter, how do you use a bow to hunt small animals unless you had superhuman senses?   I know that it's implied Elia had divine protection so you could argue that the bible gave him the ability to see, but I think that protection was meant to just make him bulletproof, plus it also doesn't explain why the bible is in bridle.   I liked the movie, I found Elia to be a very badass character, but his ending makes no sense. HOW DOES HE EVEN KNOW WHERE HE'S GOING?"

I have no idea what version I watched, but a close friend of mine just revealed to me he has the 239 minute version he'll lend me. This got me to thinking about the original version that premiered at Cannes to acclaim.   &#x200B;  It seems to be common knowledge that the version from Cannes is gone forever and those who were at Cannes are the lucky ones who got to see it in its original glory. I havn't quite seen a reason as to why this is. Did someone straight up destroy the missing parts? Has anyone who has seen the Cannes version ever done a scene for scene breakdown in how it differed from the various cuts?  &#x200B;  I'm having some difficulty in nailing down what happened and why this version was so highly acclaimed versus even the longer extended cuts. I get that it's longer and can provide additional context, but I havn't seen a comprehensive guide in differences between scenes, etc."

The Fast and the Furious films are dumb.   Doesn't Vin own the IP for Riddick?   I realize there were three films, Pitch Black was lower budget but still very entertaining.     Riddick was good also but is almost ten years past.     Are there any plans to expand this universe or is it dead in the water?  Was the FF universe simply more profitable and let Vin to abandon Riddick?   I don't know much about the the Riddick universe and if it was based on many books, graphic novels, comics, but I do know that the way the Chronicles of Riddick looked was excellent and seems like it could really be expanded on."

I understand they are all directed by Edgar Wright and stars Simon Pegg and Nick Frost, but the three movies are completely unrelated to each other. I always understood a trilogy as three stories that coincide with one another, or at least remain in the same universe. What am I missing?  EDIT: Ok thanks everyone for responding. It is not a trilogy, just as I thought. It's just linked by Cornetto ice cream flavors.  EDIT #2: ok so apparently the definition of trilogy is extremely loose."

Affairs seem to be a relatively common theme in movies, as it is in life I suppose, but it seems pretty often used as a device in movies...its dramatic, it causes conflicts, its 'steamy' in many cases..."

In the middle of the movie I had a very strong impression this entire movie was a prank, designed to appear like a normal innocuous movie for the first 30 minutes-or-so-before it shifts to a bonkers parody. Like it literally feels like a comedy.  Spoilers with some of the plot details I can remember: >!The boyfriend gets replaced with an alien, but theres a surprsingly effective misdirection where the movie frames it as though the girlfriend was the one who got replaced. The alien's powers are really just a super-cheap looking long CGI finger knife which seems more goofy than menacing! The alien eventually confronts her, realizing the jig is up, but then is like I absorbed your bf's feelings! Including his love for you! I love you! So the aliens just chasing after her around the woods shouting but I really love you! like some cheesy romcom. By this point I had given up completely and then was won back by the sheer gall of it. Eventually the alien copies the girl, and then to defeat her the girl is like you absorbed my anxiety disorder as well! and then induces a literal panic attack in the alien by just listing things humans get anxious about. Eventually toward the end of the movie she has to outsmarts the alien by swimming into the ocean while hes bleeding and he follows her into the water and gets attacked by A FUCKING SHARK!! WHAT! Then it has a this invasion is just the beginning lame ending.!<  Theres probably some details im forgetting"

I hope this is enough characters to meet the 300 min post:)"
