        "body": "For those that have no idea what I'm talking about, in 2016, a dystopian film called *The Thinning* was released on YouTube Premium (then known as YouTube Red). The film was directed by Michael Gallagher and stars YouTuber Logan Paul (who has been infamous for many controversies) and actress Peyton List.  To keep things short, the film centered around a future where overpopulation has ravaged the world's resources in 2039 and the United Nations begins to require all nations to cut down their populations by 5%. The United States passes a law that requires students to take a test where the lowest scoring students are executed in order to cut down the population. The film's sequel (*The Thinning: New World Order*) focuses more on exposing a hidden plot within the Thinning surrounding the tech corporation Assuru Global while setting up a rebellion against the system as a heated presidential election takes place.  The films had an interesting (although very flawed) concept and some themes surrounding authoritarianism, democratic backsliding, and the pressure that comes when taking school exams (although once again, very flawed and poorly done). There were even some allusions to real-life with the pro-Thinning Texas governor (who is running for election) in the film essentially representing a Trumpian figure that claims to flush away the parasites along with representing some of the political fears of democratic decline in the United States. However, what made the film very flawed was its poor attempt at worldbuilding (since we never see what the United States is like outside of Texas) and its casting choices since this film was meant for YouTube's targeted teenage audience rather than to make a compelling and interesting story.  Both films ended on a cliffhanger with the second one ending with >!many citizens (including the anti-Thinning presidential candidate and the main characters) being arrested in a political purge (similar to the real-life Night of the Long Knives) instigated by the CEO of the tech corporation Assuru Global (who is also the wife of the Texas governor who ran for the presidency).!< A third film is teased with the characters hinting that they are going to war against the government but however, no third film has been released and to this day, people who are fans of the films (which probably consists of teenagers) are demanding for one in the comment sections despite everyone (especially the director Michael Gallagher) moving on to better things (while Logan Paul gets into more controversy).  I'm just wondering on what people's thoughts on them (if anyone remembers at all)."

The plot and script is interesting and unique with twists and symbolism so well done it definitely warrants a rewatch. Its direction and cinematography rocks, providing a neo-noir look.

One of the things Rian Johnson mentioned was that bad guys were not allowed to use Apple product placement. Johnson couldn't show his villain using an iPhone in *Knives Out*, although there was a tongue-in-cheek reference to this rule in *Glass Onion*.  The rule seems stupid to me. Lots of villains tend to have expensive, luxurious things. I would fully expect Hans Gruber from *Die Hard* to have a much more expensive stuff than John McClane. Gruber wears an extremely nice suit, and McClane spends most of the movie in a cheap-looking tank top. Its part of McClane's character that he is insecure that his wife's career is much more successful than his own.  I bet some watch company paid a lot of money to get Alan Rickman to wear their watch, and that it turned out to be a sensible marketing decision, because rich people would be very happy to own Hans Gruber's watch.  &#x200B;  Do you think that you would be more, or less willing to buy something that was used by a rich baddie compared to a working-class hero? What if both hero and villain were both expected to have ridiculously expensive and beautiful things? Like in a Bond movie."

Warrior (2010)  Of all the Fighting Movies I've ever seen (including Rocky) this is absolutely the best. Honest brotherly termoil has never been done better and it is the first movie in my adult life to let me cry  2. Rocky/Rambo (1976/1982)  If I thought I was wrong about Jim Carrey, holy cow was I wrong about Sly. He puts in phenomenal performances which carry both movies. I know it was bashed at the time but Rambo's breakdown about the hardships of being a soldier is absolutely brilliant. Rocky surprised me quite a bit by being surprisingly actionless, and fantastic for it (its sequels do not carry this quality). Rocky himself might be one of my favourite protagonists in movie history.  3. Eternal Sunshine/Truman Show (2004/1994)  I somehow haven't seen many Jim Carrey movies. These two were both great though. High concept feel good movies that'd deserve all the praise they get.  4. Burn (2019)  I shouldn't love this movie as much as I do but the story of a lowly robber getting kidnapped by a girl incel is just fun. The location is fantastic as well, love one location films  5. Murder on Orient Express (2017)  I watched a lot of murder mysteries recently, and while Glass Onion, Death On The Nile and See How They Run are all good none of them beat This beautifully picturesque murder mystery.  6. Bullet Train (2022)  This is one of the funniest action movies I've ever seen. Nuf said  7. The Batman/Spiderman No Way Home (2022)  Of the two big comic movies I watched this year, I probably preferred The Batman (I'm a Batman fan, sue me). I did enjoy both though and they both seemed to try harder than a lot of other recent comic movies  8. No Child Of Mine (1997) (technically a mini series but who's counting)  An absolutely heart wrenching story about a young girl repeatedly abused by people who are supposed to protect her which is based on a true story. I bring the plot up because the acting of the lead actress is the greatest piece of child acting I've ever seen and I would highly recommend to anyone looking to go on an emotional journey    9. The Big Sleep (1946)  As far as very old movies, this is the one I watched and loved the most. Still holds up for the dialogue alone. No wonder it was such an inspiration  10. Jungleland (2019)  I think I'm a Charlie Hunnam Stan. This movie was like watching a funeral. Still thought it was great. Also BKB is badass  Also I watched through Snyder's filmography and it was passable"

Holy shit am i sure glad we are somewhat of an obscene family and watch a lot of movies together. There were probably about a total of 25 people in the theater, to begin. About thirty minutes in i ran to the bathroom and as i came out there was a family that had been in the theater with us that decided to leave, it was maybe 3 middle aged women, an older woman, two young children and a middle aged guy. i overhead the oldest woman say “i knew it was gonna be rated R but i had no idea it was going to be that explicit”. okay miss lady why are you bringing kids under the age of 10 to a rated R movie and expecting to to not be explicit? got a good hoot out of me. mind you i'm sure after the split second scene of an elephants asshole opening up really sent them on their way. Went back in the theater and endured the most boobs i have ever seen on christmas. the women sitting in front of me were visibly and audibly grossed out whenever a same-sex kiss was shared on screen and whined to their husbands. The crowds reaction really got me because it was so integral to the experience of the film.   The film itself had me laughing nonstop at some points. it was really crude humor but i like that stuff. the plot was kind of messy and i didn't really like Nellie's character arc just because i felt like we missed so much of it. Tobey's character was fucking horrifying, but he did a great job. the whole sequence in LA's asshole was deeeply disturbing. Manny was an interesting character i just wish that they would have made him less main-character trope-y. Mr. Conrad was a great representation of big star hollywood in my opinion, i think it was somewhat direct satire of leo, johnny, george, that lot. the last thirty minutes of the film felt sooo unnecessary. the climax had already happened and it was just about reiterating a point that films live forever.   overall, there was zero moments of peace in this movie, it's just go go go and everlasting clusterfuck of chaos. although i wasn't bored i can't quite argue that i was entertained. 6/10 wouldn't watch again."

        "body": "The Edge of Tomorrow (or Live, Die, Repeat) has a plot hole relating to the rules of the movie's time travel and who remembers the details of the previous alternate timeline. A recent discussion on r/movies of major plot holes reminded me of this, and I've never seen it brought up here. Perhaps I'm overthinking a dumb but fun action movie (with an admittedly interesting premise) but it always bothered me.   For those who need a refresher of the plot, the movie revolves around an alien invasion of Earth. The aliens have humanity on the brink of defeat until Tom Cruise's character gains access to the aliens' secret weapon; time-travel. Due to the protagonist getting alien blood in a wound, any time that Tom Cruise's character dies, time rewinds to a set point the prior day. Cruise's character still possess all memory of his prior life, allowing him to reattempt the same challenges with more and more practice. Importantly, no other character is aware of the rewinding of time. In other words, the protagonist effectively has a video game checkpoint with infinite lives.   The plot hole arrives with the introduction of Emily Blunt's character, who like the protagonist, also had the groundhog day-esque checkpoint. I specifically say had, as she claims to have lost her check point ability due to a blood-transfusion she received after a battle.   However, her knowing this information doesn't make any sense. The only way for a character to know if they have this checkpoint is to die, and subsequently experience time-rewinding. So if she lost her ability, she would just die expecting for time to rewind, and then that wouldn't happen. Plus, per the movies rules, she would have no recollection of the previous attempts and rewinds. Later in the film, she even gets frustrated that the protagonist is using his attempts to also try to seduce her, without her knowledge. So to her knowledge, she would believe she still has the ability and wouldn't be weary about blood transfusions (another plot point). Admittedly, I believe the protagonist could inform her that she lost her ability but to my recollection, this isn't done in the film.   Let me know if there is a deleted scene that explains this away or if there are any holes in my logic here. However, this plot hole did somewhat bother me even though Emily Blunt's character obviously also serves to deliver exposition about the movie's universe. I know it's pretty nit-picky, but I thought I'd share regardless.  **TLDR: In Edge of Tomorrow, Emily Blunt's character wouldn't know she lost her checkpoint ability. She would just die with the expectation of respawning.**"

Now, In the timeline where she gets to the train, she doesn't really get to the train. She just barely gets to the doors closing shut but she's able to hold them with her hands and open them up with her hands so that she gets in the train.  Now, that's not a safe thing to do. It is commonly mentioned in train stations through one way or another to not mess with the doors of the train when they are closing. I mean, you probably can, it's just not that safe...  Sooooooo, Since Helen did the mentioned unsafe act in the timeline where she died at the end of the film and she didn't do it in the one where she lives, it'd be quite humorous if there was suddenly at the end of the film the logo of the London Underground with a message telling the viewers not to mess with closing train doors..."

His mother had cancer and was laying in the hospital. I remember him having dreams or visions of his mother being in a hospital on the beach(?) with a crab as a logo for the hospital. I guess that's where he wanted to send his mother to for treatment, but he needed money. For the money he had to kill someone, wich he eventually did.  Also he met a woman he started dating, but they also didn't talk much together on dates. They just spend time together in the cinema or drank a coffee. In the last scene of the movie he was in the cinema and all those people he met in the movie were also there who talked to him (just another vision or dream or whatever i guess)  &#x200B;  Does anyone recognise this movie?

I did not connect or relate to any of the characters as I felt the daughter character went through similar tropes to all girls in coming of age films, (wanting to grow up quicker, desiring romantic intimacy with other people her age, not quite grasping adult issues but knowing they exist) and I feel as if her arc progresses in a predictable manner. More importantly however, I feel as if the dad is a genuinely unlikable character. I hated how petty, childish, and openly resentful he was to having a daughter so young. He did a terrible job hiding his issues with his daughter and instead of better emphasizing with his daughter and making her feel loved, he continued to wallow in his self pity and abandoned her altogether. I read that it's implied that he killed himself but that doesn't make sense to me because I'm sure she would know her dad is dead or at least has disappeared from the face of the earth after that trip. Regardless, I don't feel sympathy for him. I myself struggle with massive depression but I could never walk away from my responsibilities as a parent to a daughter I don't even live with. Oh woe is me you're broke, most parents are! That doesn't give you the right to walk away. And the ending suggesting Sophie understands where her father is coming from is upsetting. He doesn't deserve forgiveness for abandoning a daughter that desperately needed her father's approval. Honestly, I think the biggest issue I had with the film was how formulaic it felt. In no instance did I feel like these events could actually transpire in real life, and it instead felt like some pretentious artsy film a failing NYU grad student would make to boost their grade. I much prefer a movie like the Whale, where all the characters are flawed but have depth and complex reasonings to their actions, that allows you to grow a connection to the characters. As cheesy as that film can be at times, there's an emotional core that's missing from Aftersun.  I understand I'm in the minority here, but I would love to read other's opinions and interpretations so I can better understand what people love about this film."

        "body": "I've just been watching Matilda the Musical on Netflix and thinking how well produced, delightful it is and how wonderfully Tim Minchin-esque the songs are - and I basically thought Roald Dahl probably would have hated this.  Now Dahl is known as a curmudgeonly old git - which would be endearing (and probably why his books are so good and darkly humorous) if it wasn't for the fact he was an anti-semite, which is heartbreaking when his children's books are so funny, touching and generally have an inspiring message - especially Matilda. Anyway, putting this knowledge to one side, I can't help sympathising with the reasons he hates some of his most well-known adaptations of his children's stories.  There's a dark British edge running through his stories. His adult stories, which are unashamedly dark and sinister, were made into Roald Dahl's Tales of the Unexpected (1979-88) which he had a lot of involvement in. They were straight adaptions of his works. So I can see why he would have admired them.  Now his children's stories were totally different kettle of fish.   Willy Wonka & The Chocolate Factory (1971) is a beloved film. It came out at an era when musicals were popular so unsurprisingly it was a musical.  I can understood why Dahl would have hated it. It's not a straight adaption of his work.   It's Americanized - Dahl wanted UK national treasure Spike Milligan to play Wonka, which I think many of his can agree could have been an equally exceptional portrayal as Gene Wilder's take on the character. The title is changed and more emphasis is out on Wonka over Charlie. Plus, Dahl hated the songs which he called saccharine, sappy and sentimental.   Plus, plot changes are made. After Dahl's death, his second wife said: they always want to change a book's storyline. What makes Hollywood think children want the endings changed for a film, when they accept it in a book?  She's got a point.  For him, the film must have felt like a butchering of one of his greatest works.   Now with the 1990 adaption of The Witches, Dahl disliked the film, and regarded it as utterly appalling and although he praised Huston's performance as the Grand High Witch, he was critical of the ending that contrasted with his book. >!This is in reference to the main character, who is turned into a mouse, being turned back into a boy at the end in the film. In the book, he remains a mouse.!<   Now I happen to think this ending ruins one of Dahl's most deliciously dark and haunting endings. It completely revises that tale for probably most of the children who would have experienced it, I can see why he would have gone berserk over it. Plus, it's effectively the film heads telling probably the most respected and popular children's authors of all time that his endings didn't work for children - which leaves a cold taste  in the mouth.  Now one adaption he did apparently like was the animated film The BFG (1989). It's a very straight adaption of his work. The only straight adaption of his lifetime.   He died in 1990. His widow said he would have loved Henry Sellick's James and the Giant Peach (1996) - which I find quite interesting since it instills that dark comical tone of Dahl's writing.  So do we agree?  Does anyone have more stories to tell about Dahl?"

        "body": "I thought this movie was pretty mediocre but there were some nice plot twists and the acting was pretty solid. However, this was until the end came around. Honestly, Patrick played by Casey Affleck is such an arrogant POS. The whole thing has just triggered me insanely. Let me explain why. *Spoilers alert*  So, Patrick murders a guy - albeit a child abuser - and washes away his internalised guilt and sin by admitting it was wrong and saying he wouldn't do it again. In this case, for Patrick at least, breaking the law is something one should be able to get away with.   Now, this isn't a debate about whether the child abuser should have been able to live or not. Just remember that in Patrick's world, the only right way is his way. Of course, he doesn't turn himself in. Why would he? He apologised to himself and the Lord so he's fine with that.  As the plot develops, it turns out the missing girl is alive and well. She's been taken in a plot by the girl's uncle and the police to remove her from her drug addict mother. Now, Patrick was right - they should have called social services. But they didn't.   Despite Patrick seeing how happy the girl is, how happy the police officer looking after her is (his daughter was killed so this intervention/kidnapping is personal on a deep level of wanting to help the girl) and his girlfriend begging him not to call the authorities - what does ol' Patrick go and do?   Well, in Patrick's mind there even being a slim chance that the girl's drug addict mother can change her ways means they must return the girl. But, let's be honest - in the real world it's wishful thinking. The sensible and rational thing to do would be to leave everything as is and walk away. But not for Patrick, oh no.  The guy who just murdered someone is now oh so holier than thou. He is the arbiter of justice and moral standing. So, taking a huge gamble on the girl's future, he calls the police and that's that. For me, the wild arrogance of this guy is unbearable. To get that far into a movie and see the protagonist turn out to be such a POS is infuriating.   What's even more annoying is that his choice is then validated as the girl's mother goes clean from drugs. But it was a gamble and perfectly encapsulates how he frivolously plays around with people's lives depending on which way the wind blows. Yeah, his girlfriend leaves him - thank god. But, this guy is such an odious douchebag for me at this point I half wanted him to get murdered by one of guys he upset in a bar at the beginning."

Maybe they decided to buckle down and get a good job, but it is made clear very quickly that they really were not prepared for it. Perhaps they overcame drugs or alcohol but then they lost that something or someone that they cared about more than anything else and are now struggling with getting high or drunk again. I am hoping to find both instances: they double down and fight harder in spite of the issues and prove they can do it, or they give up and recede back to their old life.   Thank you all for any help you can give me! I need to fill the word count so here is a quote from Shawshank:  “There's not a day goes by I don't feel regret. Not because I'm in here, or because you think I should. I look back on the way I was then: a young, stupid kid who committed that terrible crime. I want to talk to him. I want to try and talk some sense to him, tell him the way things are. But I can't. That kid's long gone and this old man is all that's left. I got to live with that. Rehabilitated? It's just a bullshit word. So you can go and stamp your form, Sonny, and stop wasting my time. Because to tell you the truth, I don't give a shit.”   I love this!

It may be nostalgia, but I remember loving this one along with Jurassic Park, independence Day and heck Space Jam?   I had, however, never watched 2 and 3. I remember 2 being pretty hyped up and talked about but never actually had the time to catch it. It's ehm a pretty weird movie, feels very much like something more for the kids rather than for everyone, I didn't like it honestly, Will's rap at the end was pretty solid though.  I wanted to talk about 3 though. I found it really good? i was expecting stuff to just get worse from 2 on out but if 1 is an 8 and 2 is a 5.5-6 I'd say 3 is a solid 7-7.5 imo. I was wondering why no one talks about this movie?  As for International, well I'm in the middle of watching it and wanted to write this while stuff was still fresh in my mind. MiBI is weird, I had a feeling it was going to be so when I first saw that they switched the penis guns for a more human designed gun. In so far it's really bland. Hope it didn't kill the franchise. MiBI could be a really cool tv series concept. Following other agents from around the globe kind of like the kids show.  Anyway what do you guys think about this franchise?"

I feel like the characters and their relationships in The Irishman are better than the ones in Goodfellas, and the story is much more emotionally potent. I know the length is an issue with a lot of people, but I actually liked how long it was. It helped flesh out the characters and their relationships. It is fitting for a story where you're following a character over decades of his life because by the end it genuinely feels like it, and it makes the ending of the film more powerful. My main complaint with the Irishman would be that the cgi isn't always perfect, and that in the scenes where Robert De Niro is supposed to be younger you can tell he is an older man (I think most people will know what specific scene I'm thinking of). However I think the story would not have been as powerful if they had different actors play the characters in their younger years, so those problems are worth it.   Part of the reason why I prefer The Irishman may be due to the fact that I saw the Irishman before I saw Goodfellas. I don't wanna say that the reason people prefer Goodfellas is due to nostalgia (though I feel like that plays a role), but due to the similarity in subject matter of the films I feel like you may resonate more with the one you saw first. I'm curious to see why people prefer Goodfellas, and also if anyone else feels the way I do."

I'm talking about movies that had pretty much everything going against them, from behind-the-scenes production problems, cast issues, budget, perhaps interference from studio execs and other outside forces (more than usual), set issues, time constraints. Just a mess for the vast majority of time behind the scenes.  What are examples of movies that succeeded despite all this?  I've heard some stories of problem productions like Scrooged, Men in Black 3 and Solo: A Star Wars Story which had lots of behind-the-scenes drama, which other ones had to face similar obstacles and became relatively or very successful?"

Last night I watched “300” as well, I didn't enjoy it as much as Shawshank, but I still found it fairly enjoyable, especially as I love action. Because I'm now starting to get into movies, I want to get as many classic movies out of the way as I can. So please, just name at least one classic movie in the comments.  My preferred genre's are action, horror, crime, thriller, drama, anything along those lines.

Both of them get into a physical confrontation, but Tuco storms out without seeking reconciliation with his brother. Furthermore, he hides his personal instability to Blondie, and focuses on the money. We never hear of the brother again in the movie.  I felt that the scenes with the brother were pretty eye-opening to his character, and the fact they put it in without finding a closing to that saga was a little disappointing. Everything about this movie was spot-on except for the brother scenes in my opinion. Could anyone explain why they left in that scene without a proper closure? Thanks!"

A perfect blend of cool action and funny dialogue, never forgetting the amazing chemistry between Chrish Tucker and Jackie Chan, but it only has 51% on rotten tomatoes, and critics elsewhere don't seem to get its beauty.  Movies aren't only about the depth of the characters or the performance, they are mostly about the feeling they generate on the viewer. This is something that the critics often forget. These two movies offer you an hour and a half that you'll never forget! They will take you on a ride that is most of all goofy, but in retrospect something very, very valluable... they made you forget your real life and took you into a world much like yours, but somehow different -as in a dream- and made you laugh and giggle like a schoolboy.

I asked him “so when someone says something like “yeah it's like Groundhog Day,” what do you think that means?”   He said “I have no idea what that means.” Which is somehow hilarious to me bc it's such a common expression for every day feeling the same or a repetitive experience. And I know I've said it to him in the past and probably other people have too, and like what did he think it meant?!  Anyway, it got me thinking—what are some other common expressions/references from movies that may whoosh over others' heads if they aren't familiar with the movie?  ETA: so it seems like there's different categories of things going on in the comments and I'm trying to parse out what separates what I'm asking about from oft-quoted movies.   - I'm starting to think the expression almost has to contain part or all of the title of the movie.  - The expression would be meaningless (or mean something completely different) without the existence of the movie. - the expression basically uses the movie to apply a label to a concept? This might be too specific, not sure.   Some good examples from the comments: - Calling someone a “stepford wife” (yes, source material is a book but I would say it's the case with most movies and I doubt people were using this phrase as commonly before the movie(s)) - adding “ception” to the end of any word when you're talking about a thing within a thing (even though it was correctly pointed out, that's not really what inception means in the movie 😂)  The Bucket List is good too, but a little different to me. I had no idea that the 2007 movie was the origination of the phrase! I never saw the movie but absolutely know what it means and do not associate the phrase with a movie. Because the title itself is a literal common expression and the meaning of the expression comes from the words in the title. Whereas Groundhog Day and Stepford wife don't give much to go on as far as interpreting the meaning unless you saw the movie."

I am looking for a similar movie so that I can compare this character to another one.  The ideas I came up with are the Netflix show Lupin and the movie The Highwaymen (about catching Bonnie and Clyde), though they didn't talk enough about corruption, or how the public are justifying the crime etc.  Any ideas for films that might be relevant?

        "body": "Not necessarily which movies are technically “the best”, but the ones you enjoyed the most.  For me the list would be:  - The Menu  Probably the best fictional single-handed takedown of an entire industry I've ever seen put to screen, and also one of the most interesting entries in the now-popular “class warfare” genre. There are no heroes in this movie, and it's all the better for it. Ralph Fiennes is fiendish as a villainous chef, and his idiot customers provide a generous helping of comic relief to what would otherwise be a quite dark movie.  - Bullet Train  Dumb action made smart, with a meticulously planned clockwork plot and one of the best ensemble casts of the year. Joey King once again proves how underrated she is as she plays a hatable villain with ease, and the celebrity cameos are impeccable. This is a movie that demands to be rewatched over and over, with the promise of finding a new, fun detail in it every time.  - The Whale  A powerful movie about trying to do the right thing and doing the exact wrong thing in the process. Darren Aronofsky manages to create an Uncut Gems level of anxiety inside a single, tiny apartment. A lot has been said about Brendan Fraser's stellar performance, but all the other main actors are just as stunning.  - Guillermo Del Toro's Pinocchio  The best animated film in a very, very, VERY long time. Del Toro outdoes every other version of the classic story by leagues as he makes bold, ridiculous changes to the text that would be laughed off in anyone else's hands but become transcendent within his, complicating the story's moral fabric and giving it new life.   - All Quiet On The Western Front  This film wants to make you angry, and it succeeds in spades. The pain and random death of ordinary soldiers on the front lines of WWI, history's most stupid, useless war, is brilliantly contrasted with the thumb-twiddling negotiations of privileged generals and diplomats more concerned with screwing each other over than ending the suffering.   - Nope  Jordan Peele returns in force with a meditation on the pursuit of fame and its consequences that's one part sci-fi, one part horror, and one part Greater L.A. legend. Steven Yeun steals the show with an unforgettable supporting arc that may be even more compelling than the main story.  - Elvis  Just like its namesake, this spot-on biopic is gaudy, theatrical, and full of thematic contradictions. Austin Butler gives a performance for the ages as he probes deep into The King's psyche to explore the vision that motivated him and the glaring flaws that led to his downfall. The film seems to never exhaust its supply of clever ways to underscore the sheer scope of Elvis's legacy, even as we see the man himself doubt it.  - Turning Red  One of the few big risks Pixar has taken in recent years, this film pays off. It's been a long time since Disney animated movies have had anything new to say about family relationships, but a transition of focus to the more strictly ordered structure of traditional Asian families allows director Domee Shi to explore interesting ideas about what parents and children owe to each other, and what they can learn from one another.  - The Batman  There have been many iterations of Batman over the years, but Matt Reeves gives us a new one: a Batman who's just plain wrong sometimes. As Robert Pattinson's Bruce Wayne tracks down Paul Dano's cleverly modernized Riddler (now an anti-government terrorist doing active recruitment on Reddit), he's forced to confront the numerous similarities between himself and the villains he fights. This may be the only movie ever where Batman decides to change for the better near the end, and that's not a bad thing in our broken age.  - X  Ti West gleefully takes a chainsaw to the erotic thriller in a movie so lowbrow that it's impossible to explain how it's still somehow high art to someone who's never seen it. Mia Goth excels in a dual role as a young, pretty woman and an old, homely one whose twisted obsession with the former drives the film's plot. The supporting cast is just fun, with Kid Cudi, Jenna Ortega, and more getting picked off one by one in a southern gothic-horror equivalent to “Home Alone”.   So there's my picks. All in all this was an incredible year in film, and I'm excited to see different movies pop up on everyone's list."

As I've gotten older, though, I've gained a major appreciation for it. So much so that I felt the need to post this.   I know it's not exactly a hot take to say this, but the movie is very well done and is such a nice, feels good, Christmas movie.   As a kid, the constant narration, 40s time frame, and slow pace put me off. I couldn't understand why mom and dad played it every year. Why watch that when we could watch Jim Carrey's Grinch? I'm sure I often thought. Now, though, as a 23 year old, I get it (I have for the past few years but just now making the post). The older I get, the more I appreciate more of the movie.   This year was the first year I really thought about how sweet it is that Alfie's dad bought him the bb gun. The joy and excitement on the dads face when Alfie is going to the present looks so real. All movie, everyone told Alfie he didn't need the gun and that he'd shoot his eye out, but that didn't stop the dad. He wanted to see his kid's face light up on Christmas.   The movie is FULL of memorable and quotable moments. Between You'll shoot your eye out, Fra-gee-lay, and fa ra Ra Ra Ra you'll surely get some laughter or feels out of it. I've even gotten to where I appreciate the narration style storytelling.   The movie is just chock full of Christmas good time moments and is truly a Christmas classic.

You've got Roger with his Pongo who meets and later marries Anita who's got her Perdita, then Pongo and Perdita themselves form a love union. Then you have the antagonist Cruella, who by the way is so explicitly well portrayed, who's the polar opposite of the protagonists, that creates this incredible good vs. evil story. The comedy, the funny dialogue, the soundtrack, and of course the voices are some other reasons why I like this version of the movie the best.      To preface, I've seen the live action movie from 1996 and quite frankly it didn't capture the same vibes as the original. I could be biased, but it seemed more watered down, almost as if Disney were forcing it to be more children appealing. Idk, do you agree? If no, why?"

But I was wondering whether the theme of not understanding or even misunderstanding each other (portrayed through the language barrier) also played a role in this. Just think of the scene with the cat, where Jang (or rather the transcription of his recording) misinterpreted 'heart' as 'head'. Could it be that the Korean voice message, especially the passage Song keeps skipping to, has also a similarity to something that expresses love in Chinese? If not literally, then maybe allegorically or regarding the imagery? For me, this topic of misunderstanding / the troubles of communication are so omnipresent in this movie that I was sure it had to be in this scene somewhere, too, but sadly I neither speak Korean nor Chinese, so I can't really look at the text itself."

I'm not bashing either both are amazing just felt it was interesting the duality of two successful filmmakers.  Edit: I should've worded this better and not like it's a fact and exactly how their filmmaking and philosophy is. I mainly wanted to see what the users here thought of it and discussion around it. I watch a lot of movies but will not pretend to understand many, if any, of the different factors they are considering in the process of creation. Also my favorite movies from both of them are Memento and Aliens.  Edit2: I'm also not trying to imply that fans of James are inherently dumber or Nolan fans are pseudo-intellectuals.  Edit3: I've read a lot of these and they've swayed my opinion on this a lot. I initially hadn't considered just how much Nolan spends on explaining the concepts as him treating the audience as stupid and I agree that would go against my initial post. I was originally considering the fact that he does use concepts that need such long explanations to flesh out as him overestimating the audiences intelligence to follow his lead, which could just be chalked up to a flaw in his writing. And to clarify I know Cameron doesn't shy away from complex themes either like colonialism and environmentalism it's just in my mind more accessible for people to understand than the references Nolan is going for that have to be outright taught - Cameron doesn't have to be as heavy handed with explanations and the movie is still enjoyable and digestible if you don't understand something or miss it.   Seems the main thing people here have been able to agree on is instead Nolan overestimates his own intelligence.

I never want to see Hollywood remake it, but I'd love to see someone re-score it. The 80's era synthesizer score is awful-- incongruent so much with the setting of the film that it is jarring. The plot and acting are, IMHO, wonderful; it's one of my favorites.   Of course, now that I've mentioned Ladyhawke and remake in the same breath, I expect to see that the remake will be out next year. :/"

        "body": "It's been a few weeks since I've seen this so I'm a little hazy on some parts but I firmly believe that in Matilda The Musical 2022, Matilda dies (is in a coma for some of it.) Here are my thoughts.  Early in the film her father says he told Trunchbull to give her harsher punishment. understandably most parents would not allow this but a parent saying she can go extra harsh, means she can go extra brutal.  Throughout the film she doesnt develop her powers until after her encounter with the Trunchbull. (Where she is exploding bombs or mines.)  We know that Matilda loves reading and is very creative in her stories.  There is a lasting memory of Bruce trying to move a can with his mind, we know that Matilda uses her experiences in her story that she tells to the librarian.  When we see her in the clouds she talks about people not being able to reach her and I think there was something else.  Throughout the film we see bits that state something like it's not always a happy ending.  Metaphorically, the chains that bind Trunchbull at the end are the police, but she somehow gets away, maybe saying she evaded the law?  The chokey resembles a coffin in the middle of nowhere that Matilda breaks like she is fighting death? At the end she reveals plenty more like she had a plan to kill all of the children, but Matilda's story shows how she stops her and destroys them all, like the consequence of her death mesnt she went too far this time and there was an investigstion.  At the end of the film she releases the glue from her fathers hst, like she has finally let go.  I think there were a few more things but i cant for the life of me remember. Its released tomorrow on Netflix so if you give it a watch again let me know what you think.  All in all I loved the film and I think if this theory was intentional, its a masteroiece if story-telling.  My daughter can't wait to watch it again tomorrow. But I don't think I can tell her my thoughts on this, it'll ruin the magic! My wife thought I was stupid until I explained it all."

The composer that is considered as the father of all movie songs(at least for most people) is john willians. Probably because he was the one who revolutionized the cinema history by founding the genre 'space opera' together with George Lucas. However, there are musicians who made exceptional jobs like howard shore or hans zimmer(this one is probably the closest to the geniality of willians) that for some people are more remarkable than willians.  For me, something that really has a big weight on forming this kind of opinion is the nostalgia relationed to the movie at the time the person watched it(like childhood or teenage years).  So, what movie has the best soundtrack ever for you?"

We know she's in the house alone with Billy (the killer) and it's strongly implied that he goes downstairs at the end of the film, potentially murders Jess, and makes one more phone call, however, Jess's fate is left intentionally ambiguous. Upon multiple rewatches I think the film leans into the idea that Billy murders Jess since he makes a phone call after every kill, but nonetheless it's still left up to interpretation.  Personally I like to think that Jess somehow survived or wasn't attacked by Billy - it could be the way the last scene is edited but it seems like there's way too little time between Billy's descent from the attic and his phone call for him to kill Jess and get to the phone. Also, it's pretty well established that Billy is severely mentally unstable, but it seems odd even for him that he'd call the house after killing Jess knowing it was empty and that no one would pick up, except for maybe the policeman outside?  I think its because the film wants us to sympathize with Jess that I want her to survive, but I still can't make up my mind as to what happens. So what do you think - does Jess survive or is she ultimately another one of Billy's victims? Would love to hear your thoughts about the ending as well as some of the films other ambiguities!

While I understood why all those movies were considered disturbing in their own ways, none of them really ever gave me that sense of “wtf” that you feel deep in your gut when something really disturbing genuinely effects you.   Well, let me tell you, that all changed today when I watched Threads.   It is a film depicting a nuclear apocalypse in British and the aftermaths of it and I have never seen such a disturbing film. It gave me that guy feeling. It's one of those films where, after it was over, I had to just sit in silence for like 10 minutes to just to take it all in and process it.  More importantly than it just being incredibly disturbing and effecting, is that it is GENUINELY aa fantastic movie. I feel like a lot of times when people suggest a movie they consider “disturbing,” it will be a film that relies on shock factor. I've seen a lot of disturbing movies that completely neglect storyline and artistry in lieu of just trying to make the viewer “uncomfortable.” This usually takes away from the emotional effectiveness for me.  When I say “disturbing” or “unsettling,” I mean I want a film I feel like I HAVE to sit with afterwards because it effected me so deeply. Threads is this movie for me.   So if you are like me and are looking for a movie that is not only genuinely disturbing, but also fantastically directed with a unique, enthralling storyline: watch Threads"

A Christmas Story Christmas could have been one, because it was a sequel to a classic. Instead, it was on Peacock.

        "body": "One criticism I've always had with moves trying to tell a message is that the message always boils down to Thing is Bad but it rarely ever shows an alternative that can replace said bad thing.   A movie like Fight Club criticizes Toxic-Masculine culture but it's message is easily missed because the film does bring up legitimate issues that men (and women) still face today such as what it's like to live in a society under Late Stage Capitalism. While your not meant to agree with the points Tyler spouts, I feel it would have been a little more powerful if the film gave the Narrator an alternative path that he could have gone, but I understand that was not the point.  I saw a post here recently on movies who's subtlety messages are either ignore or not considered by audiences, like Robocop's pro Union and Anti-Capitalist message or It's a Wonderful Life's Socialist message and It made me remember how hard trying to convey a message that people will understand without being as transparent and in your face about it. Doing that would have the film be branded as propaganda by some. I always support film-makers not holding back in their messages but I know many would disagree with me.   How can a filmmaker convey a message in their movies without being accused of making propaganda?  I know many go to films for escape but films (and media in general) believe it or not has been a huge influence in how we progressed as a society so I understand why filmmakers always have a message they to put out there that could spark change."

But it is not perfect and I feel it loses some of the best bits from it's source material.  I don't want to sound too condescending but most people do not understand what truly makes a film anti-war. I personally don't even always understand, or even often understand. That said, I'm tired of seeing every new war movie get labeled as anti-war basically immediately- because it is horrific and harrowing.  Anti-war is not the same thing as “War bad,” everyone knows war is bad, but yet it still happens every day. A True anti-war film IMO gets to the heart of the human condition to discuss and deconstruct what makes us tick, what makes us violent, whether violence is inevitable, etc. As a filmmaker though, you really can't just say war is bad, it's like saying rape is bad and acting all smug and smart about it (cough cough Irreversible cough cough).  Anyways, All Quiet (2022) is a fine movie but a failure as an anti-war piece, and IMO big letdown to the source material.  What are some movies you feel truly convey an Anti-War narrative, not just War is Bad."

Scary Movie 2 while not as good as 1 imo was a close second. The parody on the exorcist and that opening scene was fucking gold. David Cross was a hilarious addition to the franchise. “I'm still handicapped? This is such bullshit” one of my favorite quotes in the whole scary movie franchise besides the iconic “BUT WAIT… DARES MOAW!!” line.   I'm Gonna Git you Sucka is another classic I watched for the first time recently, definitely in my top 5 favorite wayans movies of all time.

The entire final act's drama could've been avoided ENTIRELY if Betty had literally just said what was bothering her when she confronted Bob at the piano. Then Bob could've said Nope. None of that's true. and moved right on. Instead, she refuses to discuss literally anything with him, cold-shouldering him not once but twice before she finally realizes what was overheard was taken out of context entirely.   Also, it's a good example of minding your own business. If Emma was immediately called out for her eavesdropping instead of people just thinking it's harmless literally NOTHING bad would've happened in the entire movie. In a way, the entire drama of the final act is her fault, completely.   Thank you for coming to my rant. Enjoy your holidays, everyone!"

How Scar is introduced playing with a helpless mouse he is about to devour while skipping out on his nephew's birth ceremony. When Zazu reprimands Scar (causing him to lose the mouse) he immediately tries to eat Zazu. Already, we know that this guy is Bad News.  Or Aladdin shows himself to not only be an affable thief, but a guy who's soft enough to give his stolen food away to a pair of homeless children without a second thought. The One Jump Ahead song tells you absolutely everything you need to know about the guy in a catchy two-minute package. The later reprise after giving away the bread also reveals his more vulnerable side and that being called a street rat really does bother him, and this insecurity eventually leads to further conflict in the movie."

I love Christmas movies so I'll name some that are family favorites in my house.   Scrooge (1970) - this is a classic version of A Christmas Carol with original songs. This production benefits from lots of talent carried over from 1968's Oliver! Another classic musical. Not much to say about this one other than it's my family's classic version of A Christmas Carol, it's paint by the numbers, but has good acting and some fun songs.   Arthur Christmas - I have no idea how many people remember this extremely cute movie from 2011 but I adore it. It has trappings of a classic kids Christmas movie where you might expect an evil real estate man trying to destroy Christmas, but no! Nothing like that. In fact I don't know if you could find a Christmas movie where the stakes are lower! In the first 15 minutes of the movie Christmas goes off without a hitch, all the presents delivered, Santa's job is done! Only wait, one child was missed. Just one. What follows is a truly deep dive in my opinion about how the biggest enemy of Christmas isn't an evil cartoon villain, it's forgetting that Christmas isn't about your petty arguments or the glory of who gets to be Santa, or what methods are best, it's about the joy the person you give a gift has.  It's a subtle reminder not to make the holidays about yourself, make it about those you care about.   Klaus 2019 - on Netflix, a surprisingly good and as far as I know completely original new origin for Santa. It got lots of awards, you very well have heard of it, but if you haven't, definitely give it a try.   Spirited 2022 - I doubt this is a hidden gem, but it's new, and I've already watched it 4 times this year lol. Ryan Reynolds and Will Ferrell star in yet another Christmas Carol adaptation, also a musical, with a few really awesome numbers that involve huge casts of dancers. Even if you're tired of A Christmas Carole, I highly recommend checking this one out as it will surprise you a bit here and there as the ghosts find this Christmas goes off the rails a bit. It's on Apple + only I think.   What's your holiday recommendations? Have you seen any of mine?"

The plot is also fascinating: Keanu playing a lawyer who knows his clients are guilty, and yet defending them anyways, unaware of the impending consequences of his actions.   It all leads up to the final showdown of Kevin Lomax and John Milton, and man is it spectacular; Pacino goes more Pacino than any of his other roles. But it loses me towards the end, when Lomax kills himself in the altar(?) which leads to the end of Milton and his half-sister too. Except, it was a different reality all along, as the film foreshadows in the beginning. So Lomax, who arguably is more evil than Milton, gets a second chance. He doesn't have to live with the terrible things he did.  It just wasn't a satisfying ending to me. Here's my alternate ending: Lomax is offered the choice by Milton to inherit the legal empire in exchange for giving him children. Still grieving over Mary Ann's suicide and the reporter's revelation before he was ran over, he decides to go back to Gainesville with his mother and become a good lawyer. Not a happy ending because of his consequences, but he still finds some redemption.   If it weren't for the ending we got, I think The Devil's Advocate could have become a cult classic, even a critically acclaimed film."

Here's my guess:  A) Peter and Kate's: Buzz, Megan, Linnie, Jeff, and Kevin  2) Frank and Leslie's: Fuller, girl with glasses, older boy with glasses, girl who looks like Megan  D) Brother in France's: Heather and other girl with wavy dark hair  What are your guesses?  UPDATE:  As /u/Spotzie27 commented, in Home Alone 2 there are only 14 people. Heather is not there. Also, Leslie mentions “7 and 7, your family and mine” (or something like that). So maybe only Heather was Uncle Rob's kid. Again, I believe the older boy with glasses (who I think is Rod), is Leslie and Frank's."

I'm sure many of you think I must be crazy or have terrible taste in movies, but let me tell you some of the reasons I love this movie.   I'm a bigger fan of the Resident Evil movie franchise than the game series, having only played a few titles. So I am not bothered by characters not being portrayed like they are in the games, but I'm familiar enough to recognize character names.   This RE entry is directed by Paul W.S. Anderson, his return to the franchise, having directed the 1st but not the 2nd & 3rd. The movie was filmed using 3D cameras, not converted to 3D in post, making for an enjoyable experience for 3D fans. FYI, if you have an Oculus Quest 2, this can be watched in 3D via Vudu.   First, excellent opening sequence with a great soundtrack. Followed by the assault on the Umbrella Tokyo facility by multiple Alices, which is something I just love. The image of over a dozen black clad Alices running around with sub machine guns is one of the best in the series. Great action, especially in 3D, with a very cool depiction of Wesker introduced who spouts ridiculous lines perfectly (“…and I want damage reports”).   The shift from Tokyo to a desolate Pacific North West, then to a zombie filled Los Angeles, provides a good balance and shift in tone. The prison is a perfect setting for a zombie apocalypse scenario.    I'm not a fan of Ali Lartner, but she is okay in this. Wentworth Miller, Kim Coates, Boris Kodjoe and (again) Shawn Roberts as Wesker are fun.  Other highlights include Alice's quarters, the Axeman shower fight, and using A Perfect Circle for the closing sequence.  This is a fun movie that I definitely recommend, especially in 3D."

Where as in the previous films ships had engines , looked dirty and weren't so clean cut. Everything just looks way too shiny and unused. The princesses ship especially looks badly designed.   Also some scenes simply look incredibly cartoony. The battle on naboo looks terrible. All the lighting looks so unrealistic. Something CGI still struggles with today.   These were bad films when they came out and they're just as bad now. They don't continue on the star wars universe that was established in the previous trilogy.   That's my take."

Cities, especially, can create a powerful form of this kind of saudade.  So, what film or show's portrayal of a city would you consider particularly memorable?  P.S. Please be specific. 'Gotham', for example, has been the primary setting of all the versions of Batman, but for me *The Animated Series* Gotham is the one I have the most powerful sense of being 'Gotham'.

I have watched and loved every single one of his movies and they never fail to impress me. Obviously, some are closer to my heart than others but his mastery of the craft and visual inventiveness was always there. To the point where I would always say to everyone: “There's no such thing as a bad Spielberg movie”. Now on to the subject of this posting:  “The Fabelmans” is clearly Spielberg's most personal film as its subject is his childhood, his family moving from New Jersey to Arizona and finally to California to follow his father's successful engineering career. The story is a rather bland straight forward recounting of his parents mariage difficulties and young Spielberg's nascent love of cinema and the craft of making movies. However, The Fabelmans is also Spielberg's most disappointing  movie. It is the least interesting, the least inventive and worst; his least cinematic.  And so, it is with sadness that I have now to admit that there is indeed such a thing as a bad Spielberg movie.

There's a certain scene that I knew about beforehand that I really did not want to watch, and if you've seen the film, you know which scene I'm referring to. But I finally worked up the nerve to watch it and aside for that scene, I overall really liked the film. The cast was amazing, the story was really engaging, and the cinematography was pretty good. I'm a huge fan of Nine Inch Nails so I was really looking forward to the score, and it did not disappoint. Trent and Atticus are at the top of my favorite film composers list and did an amazing job with the score. The only problem I really had with the film, aside from that certain scene, was that there is another storyline with Daniel Craig's character that did not interest me as much as the main storyline. The last thing I'll say is that if your feeling depressed, or anything like that, I don't recommend this film because, I don't know about anyone else, but I've pretty much lost my faith in humanity, because you know there are people in real life who are as evil and despicable as certain characters in this film."

        "body": "Looking at film history, a lot of movies get released in 'cycles'. e.g. in the 60's you had historical epics and then westerns. Then in the 1970's you had the new wave. And in the 80s and 90s, you had a host of popular genres like thrillers, sci-fi, action, and so on. In 2000, Gladiator and LOTR enjoyed success and briefly revived the historical/fantasy epic genre.  Almost always, you have a movie or movies that cause the cycle to begin in the first place. Then you have some film(s) failing and therefore ending that genre's domination. e.g. films like Heaven's Gate and One from the Heart led to the demise of the Hollywood new wave.  Currently superhero fanchises (Marvel, DC, and so on) dominate the box office (at least in Hollywood) and seem to be doing pretty well. But at some point, there has to be a film that hypothetically fails and beings an end to this cycle.  What do you think will be the next genre to dominate the box office? And Why?  Feel free to discuss.  EDIT: Personally, I hope the historical/war movie genre will make a comeback someday, but that's probably just wishful thinking (Scott's Napoleon and the Cleopatra remake with Gal Gadot are about to be released/filmed, but whether they're actually successful is another matter).  Apart from that, it would also be great if someone made a western with a large, epic scope like Heaven's Gate (most westerns these days seem to focus on a smaller scope in general)."

He gave her full control of the editing process and she changed the films bc of it, but nobody knows that bc she was a woman. Not only that, but it is recorded that she often decided filming locations and what subjects to film. Being a female director, this is directing.  Years later, this woman would film content that would help take down Nazis in the Nuremberg trials.   Her directorial debut was actually crafted from existing footage that Vertov used for that one famous film everyone knows him for... Man with a camera I think.  Her stuff is incredibly hard to find on the internet. Does anyone share an interest in witnessing the pioneering film talent of this woman who has been erased from history and not given the credit she deserves? Do you happen to have access to her stuff, including Bukhara?  Thanks for your help."

There's no doubt that other companies and franchises will jump on this boat. However even with Mario and sonic, I still feel like even in 10 years they might still be hit or miss.  As for the other option, multiverse movies have a lot of potential and story telling and its honestly my favourite genre in any media.

Depp and Del Torro spent months with Thompson doing drugs so they could portray every scene as accurately as possible. Apparently when they did a pre-screening with Hunter he had literal flashbacks during the opening bat scene and he flipped out.  It's also just the pinnacle of iconic drug movies, maybe besides Up In Smoke. Also great to watch on drugs, the camera-work is great. It doesn't compare to the trippy modern CGI you might see in something like Dr. Strange, but they did a fantastic job for mid-90's tech."

The historical pieces of the movie were decent, but i found myself not being able to connect with the characters at all because of how little development was available.  There's a few scenes of the friends talking about how exciting the war is going to be, a morale speech by their recruiters / commanders, the actual march to the battlefield, then they all die quickly, and the MC is left with himself and few others. The most emotionally stressful scenes were that of people dying, a few that the main character had little to no connection to, and from then on the film really just drags.

A film about such a monotonous subject that is filled to the brim with the youthful conquer-the-world college energy, Sorkin's career best dialogue, beautifully shot and edited in the classic David Fincher fashion, with pitch-perfect casting and performances in a story as old as time: a story of betrayal, theft, ambition and isolation. All relatively based on a true story about the creation of one of the most widely influential and impactful companies in history.  Now, just take a look at what has happened to Mark Zuckerberg and the company since then. This is not a political post, so I'm not sharing an opinion on these, just acknowledging they're things they've had to deal with since 2010 : their role in the Arab Spring, first billion users, Russian election interference/Cambridge Analytica, testifying before Congress, accusations of supporting propaganda involved in genocide, a trillion dollar valuation, rebranding, Metaverse, and possibly a rumored resignation. There is another compelling story about our times to be told in there somewhere.   And another Fincher/Sorkin/Eisenberg would be sure to match much of the key quality of the original. So that instead of getting ripped off the Oscar (you can like The Kings Speech all you want, you won't convince me that it's even remotely a better movie), the Academy can right this wrong. An error that I think has becoming increasingly acknowledged since then, and could also give Fincher an opportunity to finally get his due with an Oscar given his really incredible career"

They have no idea how the characters are going to look, and they need to imagine the entire scenery.  Robin Williams as the Genie in Aladdin (1992), I think comes very close to being the GOAT next to Mel Blanc!! Not only did he manage to give the character so much energy using his voice, he also gave quite an emotional performance when it came to moments that were serious, and most of his lines were ad-libbed.  I also think James Woods as Hades in Hercules (1997) Mark Hamill as the Joker in Batman and Steve Carrell as Hammy in Over the Hedge (2006) are right behind him!"

Se7en, The Dark Knight, Chinatown, Prisoners, etc.  But we've all come across a movie, video game, comic book, etc. that just felt so needlessly dark, that it feels over-the-top or almost a parody of itself. This is what most people would call “edgy.”  What movie or movies have you guys seen that you'd best describe as edgy?  I think some noteworthy examples could be the entire Human Centipede franchise, the insanely horrible A Serbian Film, and (depending on who you ask) anything by Lars Von Trier. Anything else along those lines?  Edit: Well shit, seems like “edgy” is an insanely subjective term. Donnie Darko's been mentioned like 30 times and so have Fight Club and American Psycho. Interesting.  Edit 2: Dear God, some of you have replied quite possibly the dumbest things I've ever read on this site"

Instead I got what I can only describe as an alien's best attempt at making a Jewish movie. This movie was like someone took For Your consideration's Home for Purim seriously and tried to make it, only during channukah. I would call the movie a shonda (disgrace) but there has to be a modicum of Jewishness to earn that title.   First, almost every Jewish character was blond but more importantly they were boring af. Their complaining and nagging was endearing, not soul shattering like real Jewish grandparents. The story was about latkes but everyone knows that Hanukkah is really about jelly donuts and latkes are just an appetizer.   The kicker is that the two Jewish love interests bond over pennies that they find and pick up off the ground. It's like a Protestant from middle America was asked to write a movie about Jews and this is what he came up with.   10/10 highly recommended (a few drinks is a must)"

The acting and the story were actually pretty good too. The characters were more developed than a typical action movie and I was genuinely surprised in some of the directions the story took. Usually you can predict the plot of an action movie.   Sure there was quite a bit of cheese but that's to be expected. You can only do so much being stuck in one interior location, but I think they really got their mileage out of it (ha!)

Not to mention the editing and pacing of the movie, it's more entertaining than the majority of movies I've seen the last few years.  The sequels are definitely a dip on form, they keep the cast chemistry and brilliant soundtracks but they really lose an element the first film had. I'm assuming this is because the screenwriter of 11 was not involved with the other two and the banter is definitely lacking in the sequels compared to original.

He goes into that house and heals up. Then after 1-2 days he gets found and there's an ambush on this safe house that looks abandoned. But on the inside it's clearly fine.   The Old Guard vibes/John wick (dunno why)  It's a “recent movie”. Not older than 2010 I believe so.  Edit: I'm thankful with everyone, thank you for your replies. Unfortunately they are not the film I mention. It's quite odd because it was a good movie but I can't remember a lot.

But then it just went in a weird direction with the whole moving to Los Angeles, and the whole generic main character becomes a different person when he reaches success and fame but then redeems himself and realizes the most important things in life... That's beautiful and all but idk, it shouldn't really have gone in such a generic way imo!

I'm not the greatest writer with things like this and it's probably going to be very train of thought but here goes…  I grew up in the 2000s and lived through the initial buzz and phenomena of the American Pie movies. I wasn't old enough to actually go see them, but me and my brother would sneakily watch them whenever we could. They had a type of mythos around them for people of my age and revitalised the raunchy comedy genre. We even had films that weren't the same genre marketing themselves as if they were. Some movies even outright stole the logo (Can't Hardly Wait which came out first, but used the exact same logo as AP for subsequent releases).   After the initial three movies that had somewhat diminishing returns, the franchise divulged into yearly straight to dvd releases tethered only by the Stifler name and Eugene Levys wonderful acting. Despite some of these not being that good, they were still kind of big in the sense that the brand never died out. Then 'American Reunion' came out. It was a decent box office success and overall a pretty good film, but for whatever reason we never got a sequel even though one was announced and the cast had even signed onto it.   In the years following that one (it's been over a decade 💀), it has been pretty much crickets. A year or two ago we got a Netflix spin off thing that made ZERO noise whatsoever and I feel like even the original movies have faded into obscurity and have become a forgotten relic of their time.   Where do you think the franchise stands in this current day? Do you think a reboot/remake could happen? Would it even work in this day and age? I recently rewatched and there are a few of them that somewhat stand the test of time (mainly the original, the sequel, reunion and even band camp kind of)."

They had a frickin lore for Santa Claus! A lore that made sense and also explains why he is able to kick such ass. He even has a character arc. It surprised me a lot. The movie had nailed almost every part (a few characters and the last 2 mins nagged me a bit but not much) but honestly no complains.   A major props to action. I thought this would be a fast and furious kinda action - somewhat family friendly and PG at best, but no. I'm glad the filmmakers made the movie so goddamn violent and gory. The movie certainly earned and deserved the title.  David Harbour was amazing! He had no business being that good of a Santa but here we are. Honestly I wouldn't mind watching a sequel for this movie. Alos I would love a prequel explaining Santa's lore because if you watch and for those who have watched know how badass those few glimpses of past were.

Her wife is the representation of a never satisfied/unhappy wife. Joe is a representation of average joe. Rascal is guilt.   Also it is hinted by earlier convo that he ate his friend, but didn't enjoy it (all the random question to Joe about eating human, eating human is gross).  The one thing I didn't understand was when he said I don't want to do this anymore  Why did she said It don't work that way   Finally at the end I think a good metaphor it showed the wife throwing a bouquet of lavender. Get it? Lavender/love ender. But her face is evil so wicked. This is one of the reasons I didn't understand the scene I mentioned, because it seems like what Joe did was justified (in the film of course not in real life, this is fiction)"

I've obviously watched the Disney animated version, and now I've read the book I can see how they've cleverly implemented various parts of the book to create the shortened down version of the story. The recent live action/cgi version tried to replicate it but with alterations that clearly makes it an inferior version. Then I had high hopes for Guillermo Del Toro's new stop-motion version. But having just finished it, I actually think it is unfortunately the furthest from the book. They changed/added so much it's almost a whole new story. In fact I'd go so far to say I won't be watching it again anytime soon as it left me very disappointed.  This leads me to ask has anyone seen other more obscure versions of the tale, and are they closer to the book? I don't think there'll be anything exact as there is so much that happens in the book in such a short amount of pages. But I'm interested to know about all the different versions out there."

D. Kaluuya - acting was catatonic and truly uninspired. I like this dude, but I wouldn't call this a high point for him AT ALL. His arc in this story also made no sense and random is what I would describe his impact. For some reason lots of people give him the benefit of the doubt here but I'm not seeing it. Could possibly be replaced by pretty much any comparable actor in this role.   2. Steven Yeun's character - probably the most intriguing part of the story, made no sense. And this comes from a Twin Peaks fan who often looks for underlying meaning to subtle plot points and general mood that probably goes nowhere but up a butthole lol. There was lots of slow-zooms and mysterious camera angles but ultimately his arc didn't accomplish anything except be a red herring? Maybe I'm missing something but my general feeling is there were cuts made to his side of the story and it messed up the meaning. Anyone agree? I truly like Yeun as an actor but this just wasn't it.  3. The monkey scenes. I mean, this piqued my curiosity throughout, and I was begging for it to come back round and imbue the film with a underlying message of....something...anything...I'm truly confused about what Peele thought he was communicating here with these vignettes? Once again, maybe I'm missing something so if someone can help, that would be appreciated.  4. The ending: To me, a good ending has to have some level of threat or risk involved. The good guys have to overcome or not overcome a challenge and this leads to a satisfying conclusion (for me personally). However, like other not-so-good films I've seen, this threat is never really present, and the good guys kind of accomplish...something...just in the nick of time? Before what?  5. That saucer: now I know this is a personal subjective thing, but for some reason, the flying cowboy hat with a butthole never truly landed for me...Maybe he was trying to say something about filmmakers being up their own butts? Truly baffling stuff. It kinda ruined my immersion and I think a more traditional saucer would actually have helped since the overt mixing tropes and allusions kind of muddled an already muddled story.  Sorry for the long ramble, I'm truly looking for some discussion around these points in good faith. I realise lots of people liked this film but I wouldn't give this anything higher than The Matrix Resurrections, which was also a truly confusing journey from a filmmaker probably overstretching themselves. Also if I need to censor anything in the post please let me know - trying to be vague as possible for those who haven't seen it."

Aliens has good sci-fi still, but the writing sucks, the aliens look like crap most of the time and the acting is SO cringe except for Lance Henricksen as Bishop. Sigourney Weaver's performance is so corny and never believable, which is weird considering how good she is in Alien. Plus, it's a military, whip out the giant guns movie.

I will never stop watching them every year, but I will be adding Home Alone 3 to my annual Christmas movie watch list. The main reason that I think it is better is because it's writing is way better. I never realized until this latest rewatch that Hughes wrote the 3rd movie (and actually didn't write the 2nd).   The story is much more cohesive, and makes way more sense to me. First off, the kid actually tries to call the cops multiple times and only resorts to fending off the criminals himself because nobody listens to him. Second, the villains have an actual reason to keep pursuing the kid because the chip is worth so much. I never understood why Harry and Marv didn't just stop after the second trap, because they could have just left and probably never been caught.  The characters are all just better in general too. Alex is so much more likeable than Kevin, because Kevin is kind of a little monster. He hates his family and is happy they are gone? That is horrendous and abusive. The 3rd movie is centered around a more normal family that I can relate to way more.  To just kind of sum it all up I think Home Alone 3 has less plot holes, more likeable characters, and is generally more entertaining. I've seen negative posts about it before and I think everyone should at least give it a try to decide for yourself."

War movie - soldiers are in trenches and they despise one of their comrades because his dad is a high ranking military official so he gets preferential treatment in the trench. There's a mission where a group of them need to reestablish a communication wire that was severed in no man's land. The privileged soldier's only job is to sound a whistle if he sees enemies advancing on his comrades. He sees enemies but is too scared to whistle so his comrades die while he crawls back and reports to command that he did everything he could. Except, one of the squad members survives the attack, comes back to the trench, and reports that the privileged soldier did not sound the whistle and that's why the mission failed. May have been in black and white 50/50.    .  2. Gangster/mob movie. A crippled mob boss in a wheelchair and his right hand are in a dim workshop interrogating one of the gang members that failed an assignment. While the boss is making the failed member feel like he's ok and forgiven, he asks his right hand to find a pair of scissors. His right finds a small set, mob boss says asks for something bigger. They keep talking. Right hand finds bigger scissors, mob boss says they need even bigger scissors. Mob boss asks failed member what he likes to do - the answer is dance with his wife. Mob boss says he likes to dance too and mockingly shakes his wheelchair. His right hand finds a pair of shears, giant scissors, and mob boss says they are perfect. They proceed to cut the failed members legs off - not really sure if it was on or off screen.   .   Thanks again!

For me, I had a prediction for Avatar 2 and the sequels, that maybe they'd explore the idea of there being bad/evil Na'vi, because, well...if there are good and bad humans then it can be assumed there are bad Na'vi as well as good na'vi, and while the Recoms kindof fulfilled that role, it still wasn't what I was expecting, also I don't think they will because that may contradict the themes Cameron wants for the series and what he wants the Na'vi to represent, not too mention, like I said, the Recoms seem to be fulfilling that role in some way.  Another prediction I had that didn't come true is that, well, I thought that that the Spiderman NWH was going have a new post credits scene maybe setting up plot point for Spiderman 4, like maybe have Kingpin running for Mayor, or Revealing Mysterio was still alive and somehow still retains the memories of Peter, or God forbid, Morbius, Vulture, and Aaron Taylor-Johnson Kraven find a way into the MCU, and while there was a new post credits scene, it clearly wasn't any of those.  Finally, the last prediction I had that didn't came true was that Smile was secretly a sequel to Truth or Dare, you know, that stupid Blumhouse Horror movie/film. That prediction was mostly from just seeing the teaser for the first time when I went to go see Top Gun Maverick and not knowing what it was at first, of course was I did more research on it, I quickly found out that prediction clearly can't be true.  TLDR: I had predictions for Avatar 2 and sequels that the story would explore the idea of good and evil Na'vi, but this did not happen. I also predicted that the Spiderman NWH movie would have a post-credits scene setting up a plot point for Spiderman 4, but this did not happen either.

There's definitely some really good elements to Inception, like the loaded cast and acting of course. Using the first half of the movie for world building was also nice. And the visuals and action sequences were great. So it's not bad by any means.  And yet, Inception's plot didn't manage to feel...convincing? Maybe it's because I wasn't really attached to any of the characters emotionally, or the concept of levels of dreams was interesting but not executed well (in my opinion). In the second half, the movie tries to do so much in a short amount of time that I stopped getting heavily invested. I've seen people online saying Inception is enjoyable if it's not taken seriously, which would be fine, but...the movie takes itself seriously by spending so much time on world building that I feel like I should try to oblige.   Inception already feels outdated as a mind-bending movie, which is disappointing because of how critically acclaimed it is. The Prestige, Nolan's work that came out 4 years earlier, has aged much better in my opinion. Maybe because it has a much simpler presentation that constantly convinces and hooks the viewer."

Second, they treat each other with respect (Max lifting Bella everytime without making her feel as a burden on him). And most importantly, the scene where Max stops the car and makes Spike move to the backseat because he didn't want to leave Bella behind, while they went in search for Anna. That moment is one of the most beautiful moments - to love is to think of your significant other even in times of rush and not disregard or leave them alone."

Do you need to be in the cinema world and understand it to get the full experience ?   For instance, i found synecdoche new york to be a similar kind of movie with much better characters and story imo.  I'm really curious if it's just me or does anyone else feel the same.  cheers :)"

I wouldn't necessarily ask for a Sam Elliott or a John Wayne type that would just turn the movie into a caricature of itself and I am guessing director Jane Campion wanted avoid that partly by casting him for the role but I think it was too far out of the expectations which made him stick out in a bad way. I remember thinking to myself while watching, this is a great story but I keep losing my immersion every time Cumberbatch appears on the screen.

        "body": "   As the year comes to a close, I've been looking back at the film/tv scores that have stood out and made a lasting impression on me from 2022 and would love to hear any of your favorite scores as well, I'm sure there's plenty I've missed that I ought to have seen/heard!  Now, my personal favorites are scores that I consider 10/10: they have enhanced the cinematic experience by elevating the films they were  written for to new heights, and both integrate perfectly into the film as well as stand out as a stand-alone listening experience.  **Babylon**, Justin Hurwitz.  Amazing film, amazing score, I've had it on repeat  since the day the score was released.  Lovely style throughout, killer melodies, incredibly in-your-face in the best of ways.  **Glass Onion**, Nathan Johnson.  Also an amazing film with an amazing score.  The  score fit perfectly, was allowed to really be a character in the film, and I love the overall classic-hollywood-murder-mystery style that was allowed to be really prominent.  **All Quiet on the Western Front**,   Volker Bertelmann.  A surprising stand out film and score for me; it's an utterly visceral film that I think everyone should watch.  The  score legitimately gave me goosebumps a few times, and really added to the viewing experience.  And it makes me feel all sorts of things listening to it on its own.  **Station 11**, Dan Romer.  Beautiful show with a beautiful & eclectic score.  The show came out end of '21 but the score wasn't released until '22, so I'm counting it as a 2022 score release.  The stand out tracks make me want to sit and weep because things are beautiful and heartbreaking at  the same  time.  **House of the Dragon**,  Ramin Djawadi.  One of the few elements that maintained quality throughout GOT was Djawadi's score, and his work on HOTD did not disappoint.  I loved the show and loved the score more.     The  following scores are 10/10's in that they were utterly fantastic in the  context of the films they were written for, but are not ones I've actively sought out or felt was a great listening experience on their  own (though that's certainly subject to change!):  **The Banshees of Inisherin** by Carter Burwell, **Bones and All** by Reznor/Ross, **Everything Everywhere All at Once** by Son Lux, **Where the Crawdads Sing** by Mychael Danna, **Nope** by Michael Abels, **Top Gun Maverick** by Zimmer/Balfe/Faltermeyer/Gaga, **The Batman** by Michael Giacchino, and **Andor** by Nicholas Britell.     And then scores that I generally liked but have some form of a caveat, keeping them out of my favorites for the year:  **Prey**, Sarah Schachner.  This one ALMOST made it to my personal favorites but not quite.  Phenomenal score for a surprisingly great movie with a few  stand out tracks, would highly recommend anyone see it who has not.  **Kenobi**, John Williams.  The main theme was great, but that's the only thing I really enjoyed.  **The Rings of Power**, Bear McCreary.  There's parts I liked and it generally fit the show well, but it somehow lacked heart and isn't something I've enjoyed by itself.  **Black Panther Wakanda Forever**, Ludwig Göransson.  Solid score, some really dope added elements with the Mayan materials, but as a whole I didn't love the score as much as I would have liked.  **Turning Red**, Ludwig Göransson.  I've only heard a few tracks from it and have not seen the movie but WOW those few tracks are perfect.  **Kimi**, Cliff Martinez.  A bit of a departure from what I'm used to hearing Martinez do, but I liked it in the film!  **Women Talking,**   Hildur Guðnadóttir.  I haven't seen the movie yet and have only heard parts of the score, but the parts I've heard are great and, like Martinez, a departure from what I'm used to hearing with her scores.  **Jurassic World Dominion** by Michael Giacchino, **Doctor Strange Mutiverse of Madness** by Danny Elfman, and **Thor Love and Thunder** by Michael Giacchino.  These three were all fine...the scores generally fit the movies well, but there's things I really wished had been changed or done differently, and they ultimately fell a little flat for me even if  there's tracks in them all that I enjoyed.  Apologies for the hugely long and rambling post...I get excited talking about film scoring, clearly.  What scores have you really enjoyed this year?  Are there ones I'm missing that I really need to hear?"

And not just a song they thought sounded cool... lyrics that reference the films. 'Flash' more so, of course, but 'Princes of the Universe' is pretty heavily influenced by Highlander aswell.    So if you originally have these movies at a 6/10... I think the addition of Queen should boost them up to at least an 8/10. Cause to fair, no other film can ever have Queen do their soundtrack. Sure, you can get Brian May to write it... but without Freddie it wouldn't be the same.    Now I'm not here to pretend Queen is everyone's taste... but I think you have to respect the fact that the band only ever did original songs for these two movies. Regardless of reason or circumstances. That makes them unique films. Rare, perhaps?     I will also shout-out Labyrinth whilst I'm here. Not only did David Bowie do every single song... even the baby vocals... but he also acted and helped with the dance choreography in the film. And Freddie and David were both friends. So it's all connected. May they both rest in peace."

Sandra Bullock (Annie) and Jason Patric (Alex) severely lacked the chemistry that the Sandra Bullock and Keanu Reeves (Jack) had but Willem Dafoe (Geiger) always plays a good bad-guy and there is enough action, jeopardy and humour to keep you mildly entertained throughout.   I thought the introduction was actually quite good, it showed Annie is still the same loveable goof as from the first film and Alex although not as bad-ass as Jack does have something about him. Fairly quickly after they get on the boat it starts to kick off, straight in to the action which was another positive. It's always nice to see the 'bad-guy' thwarting the 'good-guys' first few attempts at 'saving the day' (admittedly it would be nice if he did more than tap a few keys on a keypad to do it but i get it, he's a hacker) and much like the first one It's not quite as simple as surviving the initial threat.  Admittedly the beginning of the end sequence is pretty interminable, after they narrowly avoid the oil tanker they then proceed with a drawn out, slow collision with a harbour, which felt so unnecessarily long and entirely predictable. I don't know if this was left in to just pad the length of the movie or what but it just feels so anti-climatic.   Ultimately I just think that's its an average film, it doesn't do anything really well and has plenty of flaws but a score of 4% on rotten tomatoes seems harsh."

I'm assuming because they are trying to reach  a wider audience (Friday is more geared towards the black community and Next Friday towards the white community).

But then they played the wrong movie instead of Little Rascals. They showed this guy running away from something and then being captured and hanged at some point in the past. I feel like he had a moustache, possibly handlebar. I think it then switched to a contemporary time and followed a woman possibly in the same house the man who was hanged had been in. I'm remembering, like, a dormer attic/farm house type house. Then YTV realized the error, cut off the broadcast, and switched to playing Freaky Stories while they sorted it out. I was sufficiently shook (and I never did see Little Rascals).   I wonder if anyone else remembers this and might remember what movie that was?? It's always bothered me!!"

The alien eventually confronts her, realizing the jig is up, but then is like I absorbed your bf's feelings! Including his love for you! I love you!

I'd been hearing all about this great twist forever, and how King liked it better than his own ending, so admittedly my expectations were moderately high.  We get started and my brain starts immediately connecting dots- our main man is a scifi artist, spooky military fog happens, and all of a sudden we've got unseen scifi monsters roaming about.   Then we get evidence of one of the creature's tentacles- but it mysteriously disappears when the strong-minded guy who doesn't believe in that shit comes to look.  Then crazy lady starts telling everyone it's bible shit and we get swarms of locusts. She believes that God will save her when one of them lands on her, and in response to her prayers it flies off and leaves her alone. People start listening to the main guy, and then to her, and the more scared people are and the more they believe, the crazier shit gets.   By the end I was 100% convinced that the mist was a military experiment or otherdimensional phenomenon used to manifest people's fears and beliefs into reality, responding most strongly to those with the strongest imaginations/personal realities (the artist, the pragmatist, the madwoman.)  It was such a beautiful metaphor- the mist as a physical manifestation of humanity's imaginations and their fear of the unknown. Showing how mob mentality takes us over, and an individual's reality can be subsumed by groupthink (the pragmatist who later gets killed at the pharmacy.) Warring ideologies made manifest. How humanity is often its own worst enemy, allowing our fears to drive us to create a reality that's so much worse than it needs to be (since none of that shit would have happened if they could've stopped being fear-driven dicks for like 5 seconds.)  But no, the bullshit “fog dimension to an alternate monster universe” strawman is actually what they decided to go with, ~~with pointless killing of a kid thrown in to boot (and by the way did they HAVE to make the kid wake up in time to see his dad shoot him? Dicks.)~~  Fuck you, whoever came up with that lame ass ending.  /rant   Edit: It seems like everyone is fixating on the kid killing thing. That was a bit of a throwaway comment, sorry to trigger y'all. Up with the kid deaths in media.  My main bone is with what the mist eventually wound up being- a portal to interdimensional monsters rather than an allegorical tool manifesting the fears and internal realities of those who come into contact with it."

I don't work in aviation, but I would think that the aircraft tower is a strictly controlled environment, and anyone not working there would be denied access or removed immediately.    3)  How does a 747 that's virtually out of fuel blow up like the fourth of July?    4) How does nobody hear repeat gunfire in a busy airport?  No alarms are raised from the shootouts?    5) John McClane aimed a machine gun directly at a security guard and opened fire to show the gun used blanks.

Anyway, what sparked this off is that i recently found my old VHS tape of jurassic park (my fave film), i've watched it a lot on streaming, dvd, blu ray ect. I thought i'd watch it on VHS and i honestly think the VHS and dvd versions of the movie are unmatched because of how imperfect and sort of dirty the film looks. Maybe the grit hides imperfections and makes everything blend in better? who knows  is it stupid of me to say that movies are too good looking now? is that stupid?  I feel like one of those born in the wrong generation kids (im early 20's btw), but movies on vhs tapes feel more like real cinema to me. idk i'm probably just smelling my own farts :)"

The writing, the plot, the directing, the acting (by almost all of the old cast!), the characters...the lack of your typical Hollywood tropes and CGI stupidity....I'm blown away. There were so many different ways they could've screwed it up but it went the opposite way. They even managed to turn Ralphie's wife and kids into genuinely likeable characters in their own right who fit in with the style of the movies. I laughed hysterically...I even shed a mini tear (IT WAS JUST A DROP DAMMIT!). I can't remember any Xmas movie I genuinely wanted to watch again besides the first Christmas Story, and now this.

Then I watched The French Dispatch, which came out last year since it had all the same actors. If you like art, every scene looks like a photograph. If Grand Budapest Hotel is pattern and symmetry, The French Dispatch is stylized asymmetrical symmetry and balance. (at least that's how my One art class brain saw it)Each scene is designed with enough intricate detail to convince me that Wes Anderson is an artistic genius. And you can really chew on the dialogue in both movies. They will also remind you of your poor vocabulary. Grand Budapest is a fast-paced, unrealistic adventure drama, while French Dispatch is a slower “love letter to journalists that brings a collection of stories to life.” I went down a rabbit hole reading about Wes Anderson. He's written and directed nine other movies with the same A-list actors. Another is coming out next year with Benedict Cumberpatch called The Wonderful Henry Sugar I plan to watch every movie within the next few weeks."

He says “Belle, it's me” and she looks at him with confusion and not believing what she physically just witnessed. She has to touch his hair and look at him further even though just a few seconds ago she watched him physically transform in front of her.  If she was not physically next to him when he transformed back, this reaction would have been a lot more believable, but the fact she saw it happen never sat well with me.

Another kind of silly movie to watch that not many people talk about that's considered a B rated horror would be Rubber. *Spoilers* It's literally about a tire with psychic powers that can make people's heads explode and goes around killing people for the mistreatment of tires. This is when you as a viewer find out it's a movie within a movie for whatever reason. It's another watch it for the silliness of it all type of movie.

It honestly feels like the futurama joke of a film in slow motion, nothing of interest happens the entire time. Characters just seem to get on with the plot, and the plot is the most generic blockbuster plotline I've ever seen, especially when you consider at least the standard generic blockbuster has a bloody ending! This film just stopped and I remember being in the cinema, everyone clapping and being happy and that and just thinking what the fuck did we see a different film? It was the worst movie I've ever seen in the cinema and that includes when I saw Grown Ups 2 with Adam Sandler (at least it was half the length and had jokes that even if they didn't make you laugh got some kind of reaction out of you).  I tried watching it again today and I had to turn it off an hour and a half in. Even the beautiful cinematography the film is praised for feels dull to me. Big empty halls of brown with a bit of light, and characters that sit there reading the script with zero emotion. Nothing stands out, there's a 10 minute long bit where he talks to a gardener and the gardener is like these trees are so important then the trees get burnt down half an hour later and it was filmed like that was a big emotional moment. Seriously, whilst I weren't a fan of the book I could at least understand who it was after, it had a great plot with complicated characters and there was no clear good guys and bad guys. But in this film the good guys go out of their way to save people, and the bad guys all look like nazis living on their big nazi planet. Fuck me. What a waste of time, not for me watching it, but for all the cast and crew that spent months/years of their life on the most intricately painted yellow/grey wall ever."

It turned out that there is something at least barely something that would have been watchable about the movie 'cause a lot of people obviously went to the theatres and gave their money to watch it.  While box office is not always the best criteria, most of the times it does work. The Shawshank Redemption is one of the few movies that consistently reminds me that Box Office is not everything.  When it comes to movies on streaming though, it's based on Word of Mouth from Youtube. I've found that rotten tomatoes reviews and even Top 10 trending charts don't matter cause the former most of the times is too less and the latter can be easily manipulated by the streamer. Mostly the streaming movies sucked but I came to love Tomorrow War and Do Revenge based on YouTube recommendations.  I sometimes use critic reviews and IMDb reviews in case of tie breaks. What is your criteria for picking a movie to see?"

You get introduced to potentially cool characters, namely the legacy characters from the first movie, as they are gathered to celebrate their surviving Michael's wrath decades prior.   We are then brought to the inferno that was Laurie's house, firemen arrive, Michael opens that sliding door to reveal himself, then he slaughters them all in super cool ways and I do wish we got to see him kill them all.....  Then we see him go to that old couple and he kills the husband, nearly kills the wife but she survives as seen in Ends of course.....  After this the movie only goes from bad to worse, suffering from really bad writing, characters being total dumbasses, cringey Shakespearean dialogue, severe lack of logic all over, and the ending being completely meaningless given everything that happens in Ends. Plus.....they fucked that mob mentality subplot up all to hell because of the actor they went with for that.....the Penguin, instead of someone who could pass for James Jude Courtney's stunt double or something.

        "body": "So I rewatched Bad Santa tonight as part of my yearly tradition of watching Christmas movies leading up to the big day, and it is awesome, it is, in my opinion, one of best and most funniest Christmas movies ever made, and, as can be guess, still holds up extremely well.  For many reasons, such as Billy Bob Thortons performance, his characters dynamic with the kid being very well done and believable, the kid himself, whole you could argue can be alittle bit annoying at times, still very sincere and still feels like a realistic portrayal of a kid, and his nonchalant reactions to Willys outburst are just hilarious, to the other characters also being very memorable, to the comedy just being so funny, like, I was laughing like crazy throughout the film.  But I think the reason I move it the most, is that despite it being a very un-convential Christmas movie, it actually has a very positive and feel good message. Yes it does have raunchier humor and darker moments, but at its core it still has a great message about not being alone, Bonding with others, and changing for the better. It's kindof like an R-rated version of the Grinch, actually. So despite being a Un-Convential Christmas film, still manages to also feel like a traditional Christmas film simultaneously as well. Also, it's just a really funny movie. My favorite scenes being with the kid with the ice cream, his freak out in the food court, and the scene of him driving the kid back home.   So yeah, great movie, easily one of the funniest Christmas movies of all time, but also one of my top 5 most favorite/best Christmas/holiday movies of all time. I couldn't recommend it enough."

The script is very good, but the direction actively hindered my ability to be affected by the characters' plight. The camera moves without reason and slow motion shots / melodramatic music jars you in moments that would otherwise be impacting. Every time I was being pulled into the film, the director would do some unnecessary and unenjoyable stylistic flourish that pulled me out and reminded me I was watching a movie.  Awhile ago I watched a movie, based on a play, that entirely takes place at a police station as a black mother and her white detective husband grapple with the news that their son has been killed by cops. I was continually distracted because the director could not just plant the camera and let the actors convey, reserving the camera movement for when it would be most powerful tool. Instead, the camera was constantly tracking in, out and laterally for absolutely no reason whatsoever. Camera movements convey meaning and, when a director is aware of how the camera motion will affect the audience, can be used to greatly enhance the viewer's experience: random camera movements do the opposite.  Anyways, I thought I'd vent and get downvoted. Can you think of any movies with great scripts and bad direction?"

That got me wondering, what makes a theater experience essential for some films.  It's not like that this is an underdeveloped idea. Using another film from this year, I saw countless number of people saying that Top Gun: Maverick was meant to be seen in theaters. I watched it in one and loved it, but I still don't know what makes it more essential than other films on the big screen.

Both prey on a sense of guilt that is uncovered in the protagonists. Both engage in a violent reaction against consumerist, egotistical modern society. And both , of course, end in fire. However, despite the similarities, I think that the two communities, the Chefs and the Swedish village, represent radically opposite political idealogies: communism and fascism respectively.    Midsommar makes it references to fascism obvious. As soon as the anthropologists land in Sweden there is a huge banner advertising a far right anti-immigrant political party. The community, like fascism, is based in obscure mythical origins and a violent commitment to tradition. And it's appeal (as shown in the infamous crying scene) is based, like fascism, in the sense of community and belonging missing in the modern world.    The Menu is less obvious , but at least clear in the anti -capitalist designs of the chef collective. Ralph Fiennes chef repeatedly calls out how the rich and money pervert his restaurant. The bankers are selfish, corrupt, assholes. One character is labeled guilty just because she was rich enough to not have to take out student loans. The reduction of everyone to simply “chef” instead of their names mirrors the universalizing title of comrade in communism. There is no commitment to tradition, only an ideal. And like Stalinism, and unlike in Midsommar of fascism, the terrifying sense of guilt cannot be escaped, there is no one group that is elevated above the others, and even the chefs themselves carrying out this violence are guilty and have to die.    Some might call this a reach but I think at least the fact that both movies are very political is undeniable."

Also, *Dr Jekyll and Mr. Hyde* is in the public domain (the original book was written by Robert Louis Stevenson, and it was published in January 1886).  I know that, in comparison, *Treasure Planet* (2002, John Musker and Ron Clements) is a pastiche of *Treasure Island* (1883, also Robert Louis Stevenson) in a science-fiction context (a steampunk universe to be exact).  I would really want to watch a political science-fiction horror animated film made by WDAS based on *Dr Jekyll and Mr. Hyde*. It could be the first PG-13 film made by WDAS.

I thought most of the ideas it had on what would happen after A Christmas Carol were clever, I liked them delving into the ghost world and how its run as a business, I liked some of the ways they twisted the Christmas Carol formula, Will Ferrell and Ryan Reynolds had decent chemistry and I like how both characters grow over the course of the movie but the songs are weak.  I mean the choreography is good but Ferrell's vocal range just doesn't fit the Broadway show tune style the songs are going for; he's so flat. Octavia Spencer is flat as well. Reynolds is a bit better but he's not great. And Patrick Page, the only professional singer of the cast, barely gets the chance to sing and is cast as the character who is actually trying to stop people from singing.  Also most of the songs sound so...samey and generic. And the songs kind of overtake the movie; there are sections of the movie that are just songs, then long stretches where no singing happens, and then back to song to song back to back.  I kinda wish they just made it a straight out comedy, a sort of modern day Scrooged, rather than just making it a musical honestly."

American Psycho is just a movie about a psychopath who kills random innocent people, hide their bodies, and continues living his luxurious life.

Living in the Castle not being able to leave reminded me a lot of The Truman Show, which I also watched recently (wow to that movie too, definitely deserves it's own post) and there was so much to love. Seeing this old world slowly become Westernized. The bike, the glasses... and them speaking in English the entire time... I don't know why they decided to do that but it added to the surrealism, for better or worse.   The tutor was such a good character too. The wife was awesome too and that scene where the hands undress her as she kissed him... this movie was a fever dream in the best way at times. But then when they left the Castle, it felt like it became a different movie. The Emperor trying to hold onto his power, the only life he's ever known... I don't know enough about the history behind this, so I feel some of this was lost on me but it felt so tragic and I ended up hating and feeling bad for him. He's innocent, I can't blame him for holding onto the life he's ever known but he obviously made some bad decisions. But you can still see the love and goodness in him at odds with who he was taught to be.   Such a complex, fascinating and beautiful movie. Not to mention the SOUNDTRACK was so good. I knew Ryuichi Sakamoto from some other songs so when I saw his name I got so excited yet somehow I was still blown away.   Just wow, really. Such an amazing movie. I had to share my scattered thoughts as I'm on my commute.   How good are this directors other movies? Are there other historical movies that are worth watching in the same vein? I have no idea how accurate this movie was but it actually seems to be kind of honest, despite obvious dramatizations and artistic discretion. But I could be wrong"

It honestly surprised me how good it actually is, especially for a horror sequel from the 80s. It's genuinely creepy in parts (the rocking horse) and shocking (the locker room) and creative (the chalkboard whirlpool) and some wtf moments. It obviously took inspiration from Carrie, but it wasn't overly blatant. The acting is rather good as well and the special effects were well done for the time.

        "body": "**Spoiler warning**  First off I know I'm late this movies almost 2 years old   I'm trying to convince myself there's more to this movie but it screams Director gone too far in trying to be different without much constructive thought.   If you liked this movie I'd really like to know why and what you're take on it is because I honestly feel like I completely wasted 2 hours of life.    First of all.    Girl is chased on the road at night by a random car and forgets to call  authorities - or anyone.   The chaser stops his vehicle letting her get a sizeable lead on him.   He then creeps his car forward slowly to catch up because science dictates an object travelling 5 miles per hour can catch up to another object doing 30. That's how cars work.   The girl spots an empty gas station that's clearly closed - with her chaser far behind common sense tells her to get out of her vehicle and head to the gas station on foot.   Upon realising the gas stations closed she could get back into her car and speed off but decides she doesn't want to live so she sets off running into some weeds    The chaser at this point whose knowledge of speed has already been proven - slowly walks after the much younger woman whose running for her life.    The chaser is shown to be walking slowly in an area of flat land while the girl is running through weeds yet neither her or the truck driver who turns up see the person chasing her, we assume because the truck drivers never brought up.   We see fairly clearly that the chaser is a man, heavier set but not obese, straight walk, white male wearing a cap with facial hair and short head hair.    So this automatically rules out Albert, Jimmy or Deacon - right.  Ok.    At the end of the movie  Denzels character is still haunted by the past because he's made literally 0 strides in doing anything to solve that - ok?    Rami Maleks character is now also traumatised and kills someone - right.    Turns out Denzel also killed someone except it was a missing person….ok?    Cop and Coroner , fucking, cover up Denzels murder and were clearly willing to let whoever they found for the killings take the wrap for it and continue to let him work on the force - okedoke   But the missing person Denzel shot isn't the only missing person contributing to his trauma this is an irrelevant detail in the arc of the story….ok   Despite being an officer of the law and having a gun Malek becomes Leto's bitch digging all the holes in the world - cool bro.    So we get a 2 hour crime thriller with:   No character progression ☑️   A corrupt police force ☑️   The killers never caught ☑️    Dead girl gives Denzel a foot massage☑️   Rami and Denzel team up for quite literally no reason ☑️   Denzel accusing Jared Leto of having a boner = guilty ☑️   Rami Malek playing a cop who looks and speaks in more creepy fashion than Letos murderer-but-not-a-murderer character ☑️   Girl who was chased by the killer at the start for some reason takes note of Leto despite the fact she didn't see the fucker chasing her at the time.    She sees Jared, for the first time, in handcuffs and decides she needs a better look at him - *sigh* right.    And by the end - everything that happened in the movie becomes null, void and useless - why?    Becuase Albert Palm tree prime suspect is fucking dead.   Whether it was or wasn't him is now irrelevant - if it was he'll never pay and if it wasn't an innocent man's dead and Jimmys off the case anyway.    That's it. That's the conclusion of a 2 hour story    Creepy Albert for some reason has access to a plot of land - he convinces Malek, the police officer with a gun, to get into *his* car and then start digging up random bits of the land    He states that Deacon isn't welcome to join them yet he knows Deacons there, in Alberts time onscreen it's shown he's very aware of Deacons presence when following him - he knows Deacons a police officer whose going to probably notice his partners gone and so is the car he's been tailing all day.    Despite all of this Albert who is clearly not the killer, plans to kill Jimmy - the director who wanted to 'do something different' then has Jimmy smack Albert with a shovel which in typical fashion is enough to kill him instantly.    Nothing is discovered, no one is recovered and nothing really happens."

Joy leaves the party to commit suicide, this is represented by the everything bagel that is revealed to be a black hole (death) and why Joy asks her mother to “let her go.” Since we know Evelyn repeatedly told her daughter she was getting fat, it is assumed that she probably did say it again in the parking lot but that they probably didn't hug afterwards like Evelyn recalls. Joy most likely went home and poisoned herself with an everything bagel. It is the last 'real' memory Evelyn has of Joy, and it's also why the memory isn't portrayed in another dimension. After the death of their daughter, Waymond continues with the divorce, and Evelyn presumably loses the family business. The memories Evelyn has of Deidra are real, and she absolutely loved her but they are seen as happening in the hotdog dimension because the relationship happens after the events of the movie and while Evelyn's dementia is in a worse state. The movie probably takes place in a much older Evelyn's mind, and the ending we see is how she thinks the events actually took place. We can see one last glimpse into how Evelyn zones out (dementia) right before the closing scene."

Not only did she do all of that but she actually fakes a whole different crime to another guy and kills him just to get back to her husband.  There was a scene in the hospital where she called out the lead detective or officer for her being incompetent with how she handled the case. Usually in movies it'll be some kind of revenge thing or some way that the cop just HAS to get the truth. There was none of that. In the end there was no savior or magical evidence that arrested her.   They ended it with just truth and I felt that was one of the more realistic ways a movie has ended. I didn't see it coming at all and I actually was just waiting for something. A wire or a mistake.

Great stuff  -Seeing Titane, with only a young couple, the young couple then left about a half an hour through it. And I got to watch a great movie all by myself, so I could laugh hysterically when she does a seductive dance in the firehouse  -Seeing Barbarian with a great crowd on opening Thursday night, and genuinely shocked at how much I loved it, considering marketing was pretty nill leading up to it.  -Seeing The Green Knight with a group of high people around my age, no one was disrespectful, everyone was just taking in everything and just having a crazy experience considering the content. They were genuinely into it, even though they didn't know what to think when it ended.  -Saw Thousand Years of Longing in an empty theater, wish I liked it more, but being all by myself and only paying $7 for a ticket is the best thing in the world"

A problem I see in these films are that they don't offer solutions to these lonely men, rather they emphasise that there is no exit out of this crazy world and the protagonists of their respective stories continue to suffer and recieve no help for their struggle. Are there any films out there which are able to simultaniously tap into the minds of these lonely men, and also show them that there's a way out of the cycle of loneliness and depression? Lonely men are able to relate towards these characters, but the characters they relate to are given no way to escape their cycle of loneliness, and so these men are gonna start believing that there's no escape for them too. What I believe is needed is a story that can show these men who need desperate help that there's still hope to hold onto, and that this cycle of loneliness isn't forever."

        "body": "So if you don't know the 300 movies were originally going to spark a full anthology series taking place in different battles across history. Zach Snyder wanted to make a movie taking place in the American Revolution, but Rise of an Empire was so bad he canceled it. So I watched Filmento's take on Rise of an Empire and thought up the perfect idea for a 300-style American war movie. Looking at all the aspects of the other two to make it.   1. Strong character  What made 300 such a good movie was its leading character, Leonidas was the King of Sparta and an inspiration to all of Greece. The movie shows this by having him go through struggles and trials, we see his origins as a young boy who was always on the verge of death and we see how it made him a skilled warrior and aspiring leader. But Rise of an Empire doesn't have that, hell, I don't even remember the main character's name. He's just an Athenian hoplite who killed Xerxes's father and is fighting a fleet that is never given any importance.   This is something we can fix with the Revolutionary War movie, George Washington is already the perfect candidate for the movie. As American history portrays him, he was a Virginian farmer who got selected for the British Army and lead a group of Natives to attack a French fort, triggering the French and Indian War. Already we have a backstory that can be delivered in perfect Zach Snyder fashion. George Washington also had to go through obstacles and challenges, he wasn't a good general in his early time and had to work to be the best, when the nation founded the Articles of Confederation had no way of collecting taxes for the states which caused his men to starve. He and his army were going to collapse until a Mercenary came and helped train the men. Hell, we could even give him John Wick fighting styles to make his character better.   2.  Exaggerated world  The point of 300 was that it was propaganda told by an untrustworthy narrator who explained everything the same as any Greek man in the war would think during ancient times. The Persian army was mostly dudes and skilled warriors, but the movie showed dudes, giant animals, immortal demons, and even whatever the hell that big guy was. Rise of an Empire didn't have this, sure we had dudes in tighty whities killing fully clothed dudes, but that was it. The only cool element of that movie was those shark monsters that are only a dream sequence.   The American Revolution was full of propaganda portraying the British as killers shooting innocent people and Americans as freedom fighters. The British enlisted different types of men to help fight for their cause as well. These included Native American warriors, Hessian Mercenaries, and escaped slaves. Hessians were already seen as boogeyman-type figures by the Colonists so it wouldn't be hard to portray them the same way immortals are portrayed in the movies. They could be these weird green reptilian monsters that speak inhumanely or giant black knights on horseback chopping people's heads off. Natives obviously could be seen in a similar way.   We could even have creatures from Native American mythology and European lore fighting on both sides creating chaos. Maybe Washington needs the help of an Oneida Shaman who takes him on a drug trip like in a Far Cry game. There could be giant wolves ripping throats or Bigfoot even, that's a no-brainer.   Obviously, historical accuracy wouldn't be a problem here since when did the last two films focus on that?   I'm not saying this would be a good idea, but it at least makes a sequel worthy of 300's name, what are your suggestions?"

Andi then begins to break all the different glass art before throwing the Klear into the fire which ignites the helium which has been gathering inside the house due to the house running entirely off this new unstable fuel.!<  &#x200B;  >!So my question is why did she break the glass art? i know the house ran off the fuel but was it said that the statues themselves were made of the same substance and by breaking them she was releasing more of the flammable gas into the house? it seemed like the house was already filled with the gas and so really all she needed to do was throw the fuel in the fire to start everything burning.

I know that Mattel wouldn't take such a huge risk with their most iconic brand, but I just can't see Ryan Gosling on the screen in a hyper realistic Barbie world and not assume that there isn't something hiding below the surface.  At this point I'm scared that I'll walk into the theater expecting a bait and switch but just end up sitting in a room filled with 10 year old girls and their moms who are unnerved by my presence for 2 hours.

All of these were a great experience at the theater as well but my top 3 left me thinking about them for days and multiple viewings at the theater.   Everything Everywhere All at Once- The most creative, touching and crazy movie I've ever seen and really resonated with me. I still don't understand how they managed to make such a wild movie so easy to follow and understand. My new favorite film of all time.  Top Gun: Maverick- A true old school Hollywood blockbuster that demanded to be seen in IMAX and man it was INTENSE! Knowing how it was filmed in real jets and what the actors went through to make this film happen really added to the experience and made you feel as if you were inside the cockpit with them.  Avatar: The Way of Water- James Cameron is a mad lad. 13 years later he managed to pull off the same magic that Avatar (2009) brought to the big screen but did it much better imo. Visually mind blowing...I'm convinced that Weta FX is full of real wizards to be able to make this film a reality. I saw this in IMAX 3D opening night and wow the 3D is INCREDIBLE! Please see this in IMAX 3D if you can because it's the best way to watch it. The story is simple, yes, but it's very well done and will resonate with those who have a family. I was sad when I left the theater because it felt like I had went back to boring Earth. Tied for my number 1 favorite film of all time. Going to see it again with my family for Christmas!"

After watching the whole thing over a decade and a half later, I am now convinced that that teacher was smoking pot because there is absolutely nothing of pedagogical use in this trash, and worse, it could have led many of us down a delinquent path.  &#x200B;  ***The story in short:***  In inner city NY, a boy named Telly is going around the neighbourhood deflowering virgins as a hobby, while in his downtime drinking, talking in the most raw disgusting way about girls possible, and causing trouble across the neighbourhood with his equally awful friends.  Plot Twist: Telly is HIV positive (he is likely unaware) and when one of his previous victims finds out after getting a positive test, she travels through the city to find him and let him know.  &#x200B;  **Why this movie is awful:**  I could just say everything but that would be cheap.  \\-Zero plot development by the end. You could just shut it off at 40 minutes and you wouldn't have missed anything, other than more showcase of how awful the characters are.  \\-Disgusting main characters. Not a single character has anything likeable about them. The way they act, the way they talk, is repellent from start to finish, and there never seems to be any consequence to anything, bolstering the nonchalant nihilism motivating the writers.  \\-The naturalistic storytelling is matched with a lack of any clear message other than: the world is going to hell, no one can do anything about it, so that's it. Given however the predicament the protagonist is in, we could at least have seen some come-uppance of some kind, but no.  \\-AIDS, dugs, alcohol abuse, race relations, homophobia, rape, teenage delinquancy.... all these subjects seem to be here to shock the US public and little else. There are plenty of triggers for the audience throughout the entire movie, but no clear message. The movie seems to be trolling the viewer, and little else.  \\-We see this serial triggering of reactions from several elements: -the sexual dialogue by Telly, then the boys, then intermixed with the dialogue by the girls, the fight scene in the park with the racial undertones (as the black guy is knocked out, brutalised and spat on), the verbal attack on the homosexual couple, robbing of an Asian store with verbal abuse to distract the owner, rape, the concept of HIV being spread to virgin girls.  This way beyond simple triggering by depicting decadent lives of inner city delinquency. It is a package to provoke the audience wherever possible. This is the bread and butter of this trashy movie.  &#x200B;  \\-Girls at 13 can be pretty naive, but I have trouble believing they are as naive as the main characters in the film are depicted.  The teenage girls of the movie are little more than dolls, on their way to be victims, and act as such.  &#x200B;  Basically fewer and fewer people will remember this movie and for good reason. It has nothing other than shock value, and the most vile dialogue you will ever hear in a movie.  I went into it with an open mind. The above is what I came out of it with. It is a shock fest with a nihilistic message and ultimately no larger statement to make.  I contrast this with Christiane F. – Wir Kinder vom Bahnhof Zoo which is the polar opposite of this, and with no less awful content, but with an actual message, based on an actual story.  &#x200B;  I rate: ***5 out of 100***  &#x200B;  EDIT: Several of the comments seem to claim I hated the movie because it wasn't a happy story or because it's subject matter may be disturbing, or there is some moral objection here. No. The issue is that these elements are all the movie has going for it, and ultimately does nothing with any of them. (The movie I compared it to above should however make clear that the content isn't the issue)  Despicable characters alone do not a great movie make. Edgy subject matter and shock value don't either. It seems to me that many believe the provocation and shocking depiction of the characters and juvenile life alone in and of themselves qualify the film as a form of naturalistic art. I do not. It is a necessary but not sufficient condition for it.  (Though one might wonder for those same people, if shock and disgusting subject matter is all that is needed, whether if the director himself drove over and unleashed a dump on their front porch, whether they might dissect the remains for objective value as it can't just be what it is at face value, surely)  For me, it's a void piece.  EDIT 2: I am reading all of the comments disagreeing with me. I respect those that take a different view and am trying to see where they are coming from, even though I feel quite secure in my judgement of the film.  EDIT 3: Many users have commented that this movie was not that exaggerated compared to their experience in similar areas and circumstances to what they grew up in. I respect that. However it does not completely detract from the point that the movie has little to say based on that experience, as I outlined above. The film is a movie, not a documentary, and shies away from making any larger statement beyond just a fictional depiction (albeit based on factual wider circumstances). I have been told at least 20 times I have missed the point of the movie, but the problem is that the point is not clear, or at least may only be visible to certain people, for those that hold a mirror to themselves and see something. Such being the case, I accept the limits to my own comprehension. However, from a general perspective I think the point is still muddled."

Which ones are your favorites though?   I am very partial to the Muppets version (1992). Michael Caine's stellar performance as Scrooge really carries the piece, and the comedy of the Muppets helps to reinforce the sense of hopeful joy the movie offers.   Scrooge (1970) is hard hitting, and a great musical. This movie has the best take on Stave Four that I have seen from any version.   Scrooged (1988) is a fun piece that did a job of applying the story to a modern setting. How many fingers does Mrs Claus have?  Lastly the Zemeckis directed motion capture version (2009) is criminally underrated. The animation complements the horror of the story in a way that live action can't really do. It makes me wish more version stuck with Dickens's depiction of the Ghost of Christmas Past being a candle.   Anyway, what do you all think? What are your favorite versions of this story?"

As a former stoner, I lol related to this so much  'Is that your special bush?!'  'Nevermind, I don't feel like getting stabbed tonight' - Jamie Kennedy cameo  Of course coked out NPH's famous couple scenes  Kumar's weed dream  Harold's repeating awkwardness with Maria  Beatdown of their lookalikes in Newark  'Daddy is not coming on anything!'

The chief complaints of the movie are always: it was too long too slow could have used some editing 4. Longer doesn't mean better, editors exist for a reason  Some Examples:.  Avengers: Endgame 3:01.  The Batman 2:56.  Avatar: Way of Water 3:12.  Black Panther: Wakanda Forever 2:41.  Elvis 2:39.  Eternals 2:36.  No time to die 2:43.   That's just random examples of some of the highest grossing movies of the last couple years.  The impetus for this post is that my girlfriend didn't want to go see Avatar or Wakanda Forever because they were too long. We have the AMC movie pass, so it's not like it even costs her anything besides time. I've happily watched plenty of very long movies, many more than once, but I don't understand why studios greenlight such long scripts.   Side note: Artistically I totally understand the necessity for long movies, but most Blockbusters are hardly art. I would gladly have longer movies to avoid travesties like the studio cut of Justice League or Once Upon a Time in America,"

Idk, but these nihilistic movie endings just don't work for me. I think the movie is very good no doubt and it accomplishes what it wants to, but I just didn't get the payoff I wanted. I think a movie with a very similar premise that ended much better was It Follows. I like that ambiguous ending a bit more because at the very least you're left with a conclusion to the previous material even if the ending is ambiguous."

        "body": "Maybe this has already been said before but I'm drunk and was rewatching this movie now that it's on streaming, and I started to notice something about the significance of the two main character's animals. When I first watched this movie I figured the idea was the donkey represented Padraic because he was being stubborn but wasn't quite sure about how the dog would fit in so I let the theory go. But this time around I realized I had it backwards. The donkey represents *Colm* and the dog, *Padraic*. And I started to see the complexities of their dynamic explored in these two animals and how they're treated.  These two men have a very specific and not super conventional relationship at least compared to most western, modern day sensibilities. They live on a small island, it's hard to avoid one another let alone avoid anyone at all. They don't entirely make a great pair, like the bartender pointed out, but without time, enough boredom, and enough alcohol, any two people can become friends of some sort.  And yet despite that these two men truly need each other. They're both lonely, at the end of the day. We see that Padraic doesn't really have a whole lot of friends aside from Colm. He hangs out with Dominic but really only out of pity and because he's sad. When he's at the pub there isn't really anyone else for him to sit with, despite the rest of the village thinking he's a nice man. He's likable but there maybe isn't quite as much substance there, hence the dull comment by Colm.   It's similar to Colm's dog. Anyone can like a dog, but dogs are generally seen as not very smart. Though this is a border collie, which may be important specifically because of the fact that Colm doesn't have any sheep. A border collie *isn't* stupid, they're actually rather smart for a dog, and yet he's not ever used the way a border collie is meant to be used. He's simply around to keep Colm company.   Colm seems more popular on the surface but really most of his popularity has to do with his music. He's made a small name for himself making music to the point of attracting mainlanders to come and play with him, and 'the ladies love him' but seemingly only when he's playing music so they can sing with him. Almost any time Colm is not playing music, he's at home, smoking alone, save for the one scene at the beginning when he's getting a drink before Padraic comes in.   The donkey, conversely, explicitly has something that it does. Padraic makes a living off his farm animals, they have 'substance' so to speak, and yet they aren't just farm animals to him. He cares about the donkey beyond how a farmer might care for their donkey, even letting him into the house when his sister tells him not to. The donkey is Colm, not only because he's obviously stubborn but because perhaps Padraic is the only one on the island who cares about Colm *beyond what he can provide* - his music.  Colm likes Padraic for the comfort he provides, and maybe just simply for the entertainment, hence why he says he kind of likes him after he makes a scene the one night in the bar, but ultimately he also just doesn't want him to speak. He just wants Padraic to give him unconditional affection without him talking to him, and to entertain him from time to time, but he doesn't care about Padraic's needs, abilities, or wants, really. He's completely stuck in his own head.   We see he loves his dog for the same reasons he supposedly hates Padraic, but the dog doesn't speak. In fact his dog never whines, or even barks once in the whole movie. I think this is to represent the dichotomy of him liking Padraic when he's drunk, when he's maybe more able to look past the 'dullness', vs. having to deal with the real Padraic when they're sober or when he's buried in his despair and can't see the good in him or the reason he likes him. But he doesn't want to admit that, he thinks the only thing that defines him is his music, and that Padraic - and by extension comfort or self love - is holding him back. He pushes away Padraic because maybe he doesn't think he deserves that kind of love, or people who are nice, despite clearly still needing it as we see by the way he treats his dog. The contrast of how he treats Padraic vs how he treats his dog illustrates this. He likes what Padraic can give to him but he doesn't want to indulge him, because that would mean needing to be considerate of *his* feelings, not what he can provide him. We see this with the wagon scene. Colm's ultimatum didn't mean that he never wanted to spend any time with him, he is *specifically* asking him just to not speak to him anymore. When Padraic has been beaten by the policeman, Colm doesn't hesitate to scoop him up and take him on the wagon back home. Not only does this illustrate he still cares it shows how their relationship survives in silence. There's a possibility they would still have had some manner of relationship if Padraic never spoke, but the *moment* Padraic starts crying, once Colm has to confront Padraic having feelings and being his own person, he stops and gets off. He doesn't want to or maybe isn't able to deal with Padraick's feelings, only the closeness and warmth he provides him. It would also mean indulging with things that he's scared are wasting time, even though he likely still enjoyed doing them. He expects Padraic to be able to just put up with this absurd ultimatum, because he wants Padraic to be like his dog. Quiet. Obedient. But somehow still happy. He thinks he's stupider than he really is, so he expects it to be an easy ask because why would a dog care? A dog would just go off an find another person to pet him and play with. However in his stubbornness and depression, Colm doesn't realize that the *reason* Padraic is so happy is because of his relationship with Colm.  Colm accidentally killing the donkey illustrates this I think. The fact that it was an accident is a deliberate choice. This isn't a malicious character. He's sad, he's old, he's scared of death, but he doesn't wish any harm on Padraic, he just has a misguided idea of who he wants to be. He doesn't realize what he's doing to Padraic or how hard of an ask it is. He doesn't realize what his relationship means to Padraic because he doesn't really think much of him, he just uses him for the comfort. So the donkey accidentally choking on his fingers feels like it represents the way he didn't expect the ultimatum to have such an effect. For one, the donkey dying represents Colm's talents dying because he can no longer play his music. He knew this was a possible outcome of course but I don't think he really wanted it, and maybe he felt even if it does at least it might give him something to add to his legacy, or maybe deep down he wanted to see if people still wanted to be around him if he could no longer provide something for them. Secondly, it represents the final severance of their relationship. Colm is dead to Padraic, afterwards. And I don't think that was ever the intention. Again, I think in his fear, despair, and arrogance, Colm thought Padraic would be able to just adjust to them not being friends fine and it not hurt him, but he didn't realize just how much he meant to Padraic.   And yet the dog lives. Padraic isn't dead to him. Deep down Colm still likes Padraic. He just doesn't want to admit it, because to him he feels like that would mean he is okay with just enjoying life instead of doing something important that leaves a legacy. He isn't able to let himself do that. It's either be a great musician who's remembered by many or be a great friend who's remembered by few. There isn't room in his head for both those outcomes."

A lot of movies have extended editions or directors cuts that have very few changes like a extra joke or something. There are some that can change the pacing of the movies or an entirely different ending and  changes the viewers experience but get cut due to time restraints or other reasons. So what is your favorite director's cut/ extended version?   Me personally it's the Zack Snyder Justice League. The original theatre version was easily forgettable with little interesting scenes and dialogue but the recent Synder cut was a complete change introducing a better origin story for cyborg as his dad guided him on how to control his powers. Another favorite is the “Rouge Cut” from X-men Days of Future Past and Lord of the Rings. But what are yours"

I suppose I went in thinking this would be more like Walk the Line with Joaquin Phoenix. Maybe a little more pizzazz knowing a little bit of the director's work from the past. But for most of the film I wasn't sure what I was watching.  I have seen other comments on here saying it was made for the TikTok generation with how spastic the filming was. I feel as though the director made his style more of a character than Elvis himself. Butler's performance would have shined more brilliantly... or more accurately without the excessive editing.  I guess you can say larger than life figures like Elvis could use a style like Lurhmanns. But for me so much of the film was just cringy. It looked like it didn't have faith the modern audience would be interested and so it tried making it something more like a caricature of Elvis and not who he actually was.   I'm not sure how this film will hold up. But I can't help but think years from now. People will look back at the film to study the art direction of the director and less the subject matter. I think Elvis deserved better.  I guess I just wasn't prepared to see a hero of mine presented in such a way. Anyways, I guess I just needed a place to vent!"

The reason for that can be seen in Star Wars.  While Empire is certainly more action-packed, the first film was such a quantum leap in quality of space movies.  Its set and craft design was simply never seen before.  One could argue that Alien is also far and away better than Aliens.    Similarly Lost Ark is great as it introduces the universe.  But I wonder if Last Crusade measures up.  It doesn't really have any dead scenes.  We won't speak of the two other films that feature a sidekick.  They don't measure up.

Also why is every male character a pervert? Why does every female character lack personality?  Recently I watched Dumb & Dumber since it's a classic. I didn't hate it. There was some pretty good stuff in there, but the constant gross-out kind of made me roll my eyes a bit.   Then I watched Talladega Nights because I noticed it had positive reception and Will Ferrell is in it. I absolutely hated it. It's everything I can't stand about movies from this era, and I find it seriously overrated. I'm aware of the context of the film as well regarding NASCAR. It's just constant perverted shock value. I felt like I was watching a live action version of a bad modern Family Guy episode.  This isn't me being a puritan, I don't mind edgy humor. In fact, especially in today's time, I miss it, and I think we need it back (I disagree when people say Tropic Thunder and Blazing Saddles are dated). But it shouldn't be this incredibly juvenile. Gross out humor and perversion are such easy and cheap jokes that take little to no thought. It feels like a 13 year old wrote some of these scripts. They kind of age the film too imo.  Meanwhile, I find animated movies like Shrek 2, The Simpsons Movie, Emperor's New Groove, Madagascar 2, Kung Fu Panda, Ice Age, Bee Movie, Ratatouille, Toy Story, etc. to be far more timeless and hilarious in comparison. I get the sense that smart people who cared were writing these and TRYING, rather than having the comedians improvise scenes or cheapening things out. Usually the gross out in these films were incredibly minimal (there'd usually be like one joke and not several), and because they're forced to be family movies, the male characters aren't massive pervs. I even find a lot of the female characters in these movies more identifiable and interesting as well. I also find some, but very few, modern animated comedies like Wish Dragon and The Bob's Burgers Movie to be just as good.  I even find Beavis & Butthead: Do America, and South Park: Bigger Longer & Uncut to utilize the previous tropes I criticized better. In Beavis & Butthead: Do America, the well-thought out stupidity in every scenario overshadows the pervertedness of the protagonists (it also clearly establishes that not every guy in this world is gross. Beavis & Butthead are intentionally supposed to be the minority, and unnormal). And the South Park movie's shock, at the very least, is more nuanced with its satirical themes of censorship, and the characters have a broader charm.  Animated shows from this era, which have more diverse protagonists, are even better and funnier too!"

        "body": "Browsing Peacock I saw “Warcraft” (2016) again for the first time since it's theatrical release.  And the same thought hit me that I'd had back then.  That the Horde plot is as interesting and visually pleasing as anything that's been done in the big budget fantasy film realm since LOTR.   And the Alliance plot has to be the most by the numbers, eye rolling, bland excuse of a human driven plot since “Eragon” (2006). Which at least that movie didn't have the worst hamfisted attempt at a father/son subplot I've ever seen in a fantasy movie (or any movie period).  That's why I think so many people give this movie a 5-6/10 because when the Horde plot is front and center the movie just works.  So if you haven't seen it, watch it for the sole reason being for the Horde plot. Since I really do think it's the best parallel running plot in a high budget fantasy film since “Return of the King”.   Just be sure to skip most of the human scenes because damn what a waste of visual quality and time being alive"

        "label": null,
        "body": "While many critics have claimed this film is about cancel culture, that narrative is incredibly reductive to the broader themes of the film.  Lydia Tar is presented as an absolute power in the beginning of the movie, in complete control like a conductor who controls an orchestra. She speaks with an air of complete authority, confident and verbose, pulling from a million different references. When a naive but we'll meaning young conductor tries to push back she pounces on his apparent inexperience, using his mention of Varese as an opportunity to prove she knows more. In a brilliant oner that blends Tar's eloquent verbal barbs with the prowess of the direction of the scene. When this scene is shown later in the hatchet job form, the one take and her verbal performance are mangled, the self she was attempting to present obliterated.  We should talk about the self because that is one of the main things this film is about. The films opening narrative thrust is the anticipation of completing Mahler's fifth symphony. While there are many more popular composers within the classical canon, there are few as heavily mythologized as Mahler (probably Wagner, maybe Beethoven). It's hard to explain what exactly I mean, there is something so maximalist and dense about his music, much like Wagner's, that it instills for many a feeling akin to spirituality. This is helped by various factors such as the time Mahler lived in, the height of classical music's social power, and Mahler's own tragic life, which leads to many interpreting his works through the lens of his life, something Tar herself mentions. The main thing to get at though, is that the classical canon is already heavily mythologized, lines are drawn on retrospect to connect everything together in a linear path from Palestrina to Shostakovich. This canon starts to fall apart throughout the 20th century due to the more limited range of music exploding into a thousand styles of impressionist, expressionist, post romantic, serialist, nationalist, avant garde, modernist, post modernist, spectralist, etc. not to mention the popularusic that erupted at that time. Mahler epitomizes this very manufactured mythology, and not only as a composer but as a conductor. Up until Mahler's time the conductor was still not given nearly as much power as they would be after him, and to a degree were still mostly concerned with keeping rhythm, even Mahler's contemporary Richard Strauss, an esteemed conductor, had a fairly straightforward approach to the form. Something about Mahler's more expressive conducting became an inspiration for the idea of the conductor as a translator of the music for the audience.  Tar is aware of this.  When asked in a subtle way to justify her role, her importance, she goes on a long tangent that ends up approximating because I understand the music better, I hold the secrets that none else do and only I can deliver them effectively. This is her creating her own mythology. She is surrounded by people who have reinforced, and to whom she has reinforced, said mythology until she begins to believe it herself.  Towards the end when Bernstein talks about how music is how it makes you feel seems so far removed from her esoteric analysis, and this is not to say her analysis are not without value.That is what makes Tar interesting, like many famous artists who were horrible people, she is good at what she does, but the point is that she is too concerned with proving how good she is at what she does that she has lost sight of the reason she loved music in the first place by the time she reached her peak. The tragedy of this film is not her downfall, that was only the predictable results of hubris. No, the real tragedy was an artist who loved art, who become so sebsumed within her own ego that she began to believe that she was the art. It's ironic the one thing she struggled completely at was composition, the part of music requiring pure creation, not interpretation. She uses many lengthy sentences to describe why past music is so important, but I suspect, in part from the VHS of Lenny, the biggest reason is nostalgia and the power nostalgia music can create, and that is where her fixation lies. At one point I believe she refers to music as the closest experience to the divine or something to that effect. In that sense then, she has become a god to herself.  This is what jutified all the hypocritical and monstrous things she did, blacklisting Krista and trying to hide the evidence, using her power to gain sexual favors, regularly belittling those she viewed as beneath her, which by the start of the film seemed to be nearly everyone. Because she believed her own mythology she felt free to manipulate others because she was so close to the divine morality was inapplicable to her. However, it's worth noting this self mythologizing blinded her to the ways in which she was actually being manipulated simultaneously, such as by the cello player who drops her once she has what she wants, nor is she as aware of the way in which her transactional relationships require a transaction from her, leading to mistakes rooted in presumptuousness. However by the end of the film she is reduced to nothing, her self mythology obliterated, and in her humiliation she is forced to see herself unshrouded in the mists of ego. Her experience in the massage brothel forces her to confront how her relationships in exchange for favors have been in no different than choosing a girl from a fishbowl. Her being forced to play with a click track for a gaming convention is brutal in how it reduces her role to that of a visual metronome, unable to at all manipulate time which she talked so much about earlier in the film.  Now there's is one other big theme this all ties into. Tar is a critique of auteur theory. The film opens with the full credits, showing the full range of people who created it, not letting the audience leave at the end of the movie as they roll. In many ways auteur directors are quite similar to conductors, conductors are even often referred to as music directors. They orchestrate a large number of people with separate skills to one single goal, and this are similarly mythologized, but as many people through the years have pointed out, are rarely in direct control of every aspect of a film, and disproportionate credit towards them can and frequently does diminish the roles of the countless other artists and workers that create their own works wholly from their own skill. Similarly, conductors tend to be placed in the spotlight and paid disproportionate amounts of money, and a performance's quality is frequently mainly credited towards them.   Tar is a great conductor, the film makes that abundantly clear, but what it also makes, especially with the ending, is that the performance can and will go on without her. Though she is able to give many ideas to the musicians as a whole, the musicians ultimately are the ones who's skill are required to realize her ideas, they are the ones with the means of production. And like with any transactional relationships couched in a severe power dynamic, of that sort, she needs them to believe her mythology more than they need her to direct their capabilities."

Not quite at the heights of Shrek and Shrek 2 but it's easily third best and in that conversation. It delivers the madcap and irreverent energy we love from Shrek, plus gorgeous animation, inventive action and plenty of heart to boot.   The gags never stop coming, with many delightful riffs on fairy tales, nursery rhymes and other classic stories. John Mulaney as Little Jack Horner is having the most fun here, and the movie plays as if they worked around his improvising (a la Robin Williams in Aladdin). There is a riff on a Pinocchio character that is completely bizarre yet hysterically funny, not least because of the absolutely perfect voice acting decision.  Of course, the film's foundation is the Puss in Boots character. Puss remains a delightful and endlessly entertaining character, thanks to his exaggerated panache, Banderas' spirited delivery, and the hilarious contrast between bravado and adorable kitty cutesiness.   Just like the early Shrek movies, this has some very funny pop culture references. By this I mean that it's not lazily winking at other movies for cheap nostalgia, but adapting imagery to its fantasy setting in ways that are surprising and stylish.   I mean it when I say this is gorgeous, with a new visual language not seen in previous Shrek films. Like Into the Spiderverse and The Bad Guys, the film uses cel shaded models and has 2D textures and effects incorporated into the 3D environments. This creates a cartoonish look wherein characters are more expressive and the environments more dynamic. Elsewhere, during action sequences, characters will leap between frames, compressing space and time to create an exhilarating and swashbuckling pace. Above all else the direction is filled with stylish choices, my favourite being characters' expressions revealed in the reflections of swinging weapons.  Although the plot doesn't always unfold naturally alongside the character beats, all in all this is a rollicking good time with a fun script, loveable main character, and spectacular direction.   For me it's a 9/10 and I think it will emerge as many folks' best animated film of the year."

David Lynch is almost known primarily for his singular language, but in particular Eraserhead just does it's own thing. Very little dialogue, very few characters, and the main supporting character is deliberately hideous to create distance between the two characters, but also between the viewer ad the baby.  Breaking the fourth wall is also an example of this. However, in Funny Games the antagonist does more than just break the fourth wall, he actively disrupts the timeline of the movie in a way that even usurps the traditional fourth wall breaking.

I'm not making this a countdown to the best because for a couple of them I couldn't decide which was better. Instead I'll be listing them in the order they were released (the best one still ended up at the end, haha).  THE RING (2002)  Directed by Gore Verbinski and written by Ehren Kruger, The Ring, was based on the Japanese horror film by Hiroshi Takahashi and it ended up being a monster. Lead by, Naomi Watts, the cast included Martin Henderson, David Dorfman, Jane Alexander, and Brian Cox. From the opening moments it took us on a journey of terror that I rarely feel watching a movie. Seeing Samara crawl out of that well, then out of the television made me uncomfortable, not to mention the hidden Easter egg included on the DVD release where you could actually watch “the video” for yourself. I did, and at the time my home phone ringer sounded exactly like the one they played in the hidden feature. Talk about instantly regretting my decision. Watch a video and the phone rings, the voice on the other end tells you, you will die in seven days, and people did. Sifting through the clues was part of the fun of the movie, discovering every layer of the greater mystery that was The Ring. The film today has a 71% on Rotten Tomatoes, and grossed $249.3 million, not bad for a PG-13 horror release. If you haven't seen it, for whatever reason, you should. I can't recommend it enough.  THE TEXAS CHAINSAW MASSACRE (2003)  Directed by Marcus Nispel and Written by Scott Kosar, The Texas Chainsaw Massacre was based on the original of the same name from, Kim Henkel and Toby Hooper. This was one, at the time, that I was not looking forward to seeing. The original is a horror classic and number one on several lists of greatest horror movies of all time. The cast, lead by, Jessica Biel, and featuring, Johnathan Tucker, Erica Leerhsen, Mike Vogel, Eric Balfour, and R Lee Ermey, all turned in amazing performances. I was pleasantly surprised that I ended up liking this remake as much as I did, I put it right up there with the original. The gore was hard to watch but that was the point, the kills were fun and original, the ending was unexpected for the most part, spoiler alert, Leatherface loses an arm! All that being said the creepiest part of this movie is still the little boy. I can see him licking his teeth in my nightmares. The movie is fun and entertaining and is very worthy of a watch or two. The critics at the time however did NOT agree with me. The movie stands at 37% on Rotten Tomatoes, and grossed just $107.4 million at the box office.  THE HILLS HAVE EYES (2006)  Directed by Alexandre Aja from a script by Alexandre Aja and Gregory Levasseur, The Hills Have Eyes was a shot in the arm for a genre that had been lacking for a couple of years. Based on the original by the master of horror, Wes Craven, this remake broke a lot of rules. With a cast that included, Aaron Stanford, Kathleen Quinlan, Vanessa Shaw, Emilie de Ravin, Dan Byrd, Robert Joy, and Ted Levine, the majority of this horror fest took place in broad daylight. Yes, there were scenes at night when awful and terrible things happened but most of this film (including the amazing climax) all took place during the day. No one could hide in the shadows, we all knew exactly what the “hero” was facing because the “monsters” (a family horribly mutated by nuclear fallout) were lit by the sun in the middle of the desert! If you have yet to watch it, I do recommend it, it's an amazing horror ride. I will say there is more than one very uncomfortable scene so tread at your own risk. The film was panned by critics, holding only a 52% on Rotten Tomatoes and it didn't earn much money, only $70 million but it made up for it in video sales, garnering a pretty large cult following.  EVIL DEAD (2013)  Directed by Fede Alvarez and written by Fede Alvarez and Rodo Sayagues, the Evil Dead remake took the concept of the original and turned it up to eleven. Based on the original by Sam Raimi, a film that could have used the kind of money this one had, Fede took everything we liked about Sam's film to the next level. Sam Raimi and Bruce Campbell even believed in this re-imagining so much, they produced it themselves. The cast included, Jane Levy, Shiloh Fernandez, Lou Taylor Pucci, Jessica Lucas, and Elizabeth Blackmore and they made the unbelievable happenings of the flick seem like they were really happening. It was gross, it was scary, it was uncomfortable, it was even funny at times, this movie was everything that it needed to be. At this point it goes without saying (because it wouldn't be on my list if I didn't think you should watch it) but you really need to see this movie if you haven't. It's a fun trip that wastes no time getting right into the action. You won't be bored. This is another film with a low Rotten Tomatoes score, only 63% and it only pulled in $97.5 million but I'm telling you, pick a night and see for yourself.  ​IT (2017)  Directed by Andy Muschietti and written by Chase Palmer, Cary Fukunaga and Gary Dauberman, IT was worth the wait. If you've made it this far then you know I set it up by saying the best was last, and in my opinion, IT is definitely the top of this crop. Based more on the book by Stephen King (is that cheating my premise?) than it was the 90's mini series starring Tim Curry, this movie really had it all—scares, touching character moments and growth, terror, mystery—it's a great film let alone an amazing horror film. The cast was lead by Jaeden Liebherher as Bill Denbrough and Bill Skarsgard as the inter-dimensional monster known as Pennywise the clown and both of them do an amazing job respectfully. This movie has some of the most disturbing imagery I've seen on screen and there are certain parts I think of almost daily. If you haven't watched it yet then you really need to make that happen, and make sure you can follow it up with Chapter 2 because it's one long story spanning the years in Derry Maine. The critics and basically everyone else agree with me on this one, it has a solid 86% on Rotten Tomatoes and made a whopping $701.8 million worldwide, setting pretty as the highest grossing horror movie of all time.  So that's it, my top 5 horror remakes, let me know if you agree or disagree, if I made a mistake or somehow overlooked something you think should be here. These are some of my favorite horror films and I think if you haven't seen one or any of them…you need to fix that.  Twitter/Instagram | CrockettForReal"

The atmosphere of the 80s America felt authentic and acting performances were rather good, but something went off and simply didn't click right. It could be a very disturbing topic of cannibalism, it could be the genre of the road-movie, with characters constantly being on the move. I often felt like I am watching something staged, even surrealistic and at times almost grotesque. It didn't feel real, in spite of all of the intended realism, and, hence, left me cold. The shocking factor didn't work too somehow. It looked like a disturbing fairytale to me. What are your thoughts about Luca's most recent movie?   P.S. Taylor Russell is really talented. It definitely is a new name in the movie industry for me."

On the other hand, the Original Trilogy is not only my favourite trilogy of all time, its the best imo (and i don't like the Sequel trilogy either but at least everything on screen is not computer generated)  Die Hard 4. Die Hard 3 happens to be my favourite movie of all time and boy was i disappointed on this one. I think only McTiernian understand and can handle Die Hard  Godfather Trilogy. It was good yeah but i didn't saw the masterpieces in the first 2 movies and the 3rd, the least i say the better (Sofia Coppola is the worst actress i have ever seen perform  The Blair Witch Project. Half a disappointement, people praises it so much as the scariest movie ever, i felt disappointed when i saw absolutely nothing happening from beggining to end (i've heard it was a it or miss for a lot of people back then) and after i was thinking about it and if you consider its the 2 guys doing everything from the beggining then its really frightening."

        "body": "The Middle Earth movies are my favourite media series: I like all the entries, and across all six of them (no, The Rings of Power doesn't count) I feel there's the best unity across entries, being that all of them were made - uniquely - by the same writer/director and the same creative team.  That being said, I always embark on a rewatching of the cycle a little wary: the first film in the order of the narrative, *The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey,* is in fact my least favourite. So, now that it just turned a decade old, I think its time to square off with this film, why I like it, what about it I don't like and how it stands within the cycle as a whole.  I think its possibly the most visually rapturous of the six films: Andrew Lesnie's high-definition cinematography is crystal-clear and pin-sharp, and Jackson in his second venture to Middle Earth is willing to let takes hold longer (a 90-second oner in two different scales took two days to film). The result is that Middle Earth is on fine display: from New Zealand's verdant and vertiginous landscapes to Dan Hennah's meticulous sets of Dale, Erebor, Hobbiton and so forth: For all the complaints of CGI, the constructed environments are spacious and lavish. The movie belies scale at every turn, like David Lean's old adage about movie opera - it even has a praghiera scene - the deeply stirring Misty Mountains ensemble - that would not have been out of place on the Parisian stage in the 1850s!  At the same time, I think the issue is the rate in which the environments that make this dazzling tableaux pass by, which is too slow. The film has a deterimental pacing issue: its not so much the length of the setup which, at 44 minutes, is actually quite short. Rather, its the fact that once the company is on the road...the quest almost immediately stalls for the sake of a flashback to the Battle of Moria - which is very important to the psyche of one of our main characters, and to the story as the film sets-it up - and to a cutaway to Rhosgobel (again, very important going forward) and to an episodic adventure involving three Trolls, none of which gets us any closer to Erebor and the Dragon.  Now, many first entries have pacing issues because they need to get the piece off of the ground: Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone basically had no conflict until a good 90 minutes in, which is longer than here. The first Season of The Rings of Power show was excruciatingly slow. The issue here, however, is that it clashes with what author Ian Nathan calls the bawdry tone of the film.  And this is really the core of the film, and the source of both its strength and weaknesses: An Unexpected Journey is the satyr-play of the Middle Earth cycle. It seems, says Ian, that Jackson is sending himself off when the Dwarves irreverently trash his beloved Bag-End or temper with the pomposity of his finely-cast Elves. Even the Dwarves themselves are the image of the satyr chorus: hairy, stount, virile and indignant.  I personally think its an inspired choice: the comedic tone could only work for the very beginning of the cycle, and it fits the idea that we are here revisiting Middle Earth at a time of relative peace, indeed on the eve of Sauron's ressurgence. This way, there's room for the later entries - both in The Hobbit but also The Lord of the Rings itself - to get consistently darker, which they indeed do.  At the same time, it does heighten the pacing problem. So much so that (even though I watch the film in 2D) I put an intermission into the movie at the same point that the 3D had it: right after Azog is revealed on Weathertop. Its a fine place to pause and, that way, returning from intermission the White Council sequence feels like a more naturally-placed exposition dump rather than stopping the movie dead in its tracks.  The segment of the movie that follows is thankfully the film at its strongest: a lot of it has to do with the dizzying rate in which the setpieces are dolled-out: Rivendell, rain all but pelting the audience's faces in the high pass, torch-fires licking at their faces in the rickety Goblintown, rustling pine-trees in their ears in the Forest Ledge and alpine air of the New Zealand skies, in one of the series' most sublimely romantic moments. Of particular note, too, is a standout scene with Gollum, which Jackson wisely and boldly chose NOT to intercut with the Goblintown scenes.  But, as per usual, the true core to the success of the film's second part is in its character interactions: they become more concentrated and therefore more focused. As much as the film is about Bilbo (Martin Freeman) finding his place among the company, its about the Dwarves - those lovable satyrs - accepting Bilbo into their ranks. There is a pair of confrontations - Bilbo and Bofur, followed by Bilbo and Thorin - cleverly constructed to mirror each other, which serve to underline this basic thrust of the movie very artfully and which all these years later I still find deeply moving and affecting. 7/10"

They get across the initial conflict, give an idea of where the escalation starts and sets-up both the protag- and antagonists in a satisfying way. No more questions, your honour.   This new trailer feels twice as long, shows some of the same footage, and adds a TON of unnecessary plotlines, story beats, jump scares, and late-stage footage to show the viewers a recap of the whole thing. If it had the Cinema Sins voiceover, I would accept it.

I mean this dude is chatty, friendly, and pulls of a successful con and disappears off the face of the Earth. It'd make a thrilling story. One perspective could be from DB Cooper and Tina Mucklow, the flight attendant who had most contact with him. Cooper calms down several irritated passengers, has friendly conversations with Mucklow and even jokes with her a few times. He cooperates with the flight crew and harms no-one (except the bank, of course). There could be another perspective from the FBI agents tasked with retrieving the money, delivering it to the plane and then searching for him afterwards.

The Marshal's sense of duty and honor compels him to stay and endure the fight no matter the outcome.  What are some other examples where the protagonist is presented with a clear choice: honor or family, and chooses honor?  Hollywood is not much interested in making movies where the hero can't choose both honor and family (think the F&F franchise).

Seeing a guy who's never anything but kind to anyone get repeatedly kicked in the proverbial ass is heartbreaking, and even though it takes its time to set all this up, Capra and Stewart really create an immensely sympathetic protagonist.  And at the end when he's finally repaid and can enjoy his life with his family, it's so immensely satisfying. Even though less than half of it is actually set at Christmas, the themes of generosity and kindness are so powerful that it really is a great holiday film.

In Ralph Breaks the Internet the villain was a creepily insecure Ralph who misunderstood friendship.

In Raya and the Last Dragon the villain was a misunderstood brainwashed friend of the protag who apparently doesn't know what's right from wrong at 18.

        "body": "I liked this film so much because it gave me a very particular impression on the meaning of the plot. So I share my opinion with you to see if it's all in my head or if you think like me.  I've always been bored with the parts of a film that talk about intense love stories, and above all I've always been bored with films that revolve completely around a love story.  Personally I am part of that new generation where romantic relationships are non-existent and sex is a completely hedonistic pleasure. I'm not complaining, but I also think that intense relationships could be a good experience as well and it's a shame that I can't understand them.  In this film, however, I can appreciate the relationship between the two, because unlike other films, the love story between the two characters is not put there to give meaning to the plot, but it is the film that gives meaning to the relationship, making it the key to everything. Basically Donnie initially lived to the accident just to get to know the girl and then as the relationship progressed the esotericism in the film became more and more significant up to the final part where they had sex and the world ended for Donnie by making him kill the real frank, in such a way as to make possible all that happened and return to the parallel world where he dies.  Virtually all the esotericism of the film is connected to the love story making it actually exciting because it is full of meaning, instead of as is usually done where it is the love story that makes the whole film exciting just because it should be significant in itself since we are human and we like these things trivially.  Ultimately I love this movie because it managed to get me excited about a love story, somehow making it more important than it is.  What do you think?"

He had a troubled relationship with his parents from what I'm gathering.   I also think he was terrified of getting too close to people. He usually only spent a week or two with people and then left. Probably goes back to the issues with his parents. But I think what he needed and what he was actually searching for was deep connection with others. It's a shame he was too scared to invest in that. I think he even realized that himself right before he died. Remember one of the last things he wrote was “happiness is only real when shared.” It's a shame he realized it too late.  Remember the old man at the end, Mr. Francis? Chris had a golden opportunity to form a meaningful, lifelong connection that they both desperately needed but he was very hesitant. I wonder, how would things have turned out if he'd survived Alaska and spent more time with Mr. Frances after and maybe met a woman to settle down with.  Another interesting angle is the fact that his death is the main thing that has brought relevancy to his story. His sister said that if he were still alive he probably wouldn't understand what all the fuss was about. He was simply on a journey to find happiness and fulfillment for himself.  What do you think Chris was searching for? How do you think his life might have turned out if he'd survived Alaska? Open to any feedback!"

The saddest scene for me is easily the scene where Michael hugs fredo at their mothers wake. Michael enters and fredo glances up with such the saddest look on his face, like a dog with his tail between his legs who knows his owner is upset with him. Then Michael goes closer to embrace fredo, and fredo grabs Michael as tight as he can. Just watching fredo embrace his brother so tightly, thinking he has a brother again, and knowing what happens later, is heartbreaking. It brings me to tears just to watch.   Then you have Michael with the coldest look in his eyes, like there's nothing behind them. He glances at his associate, who both know what will happen to fredo after the wake. Then it cuts to fredos arms grabbing Michael, and he grabs tighter and tighter. He has so much love for his brother and it's like his life is complete again. Meanwhile Michael feels nothing.  There's so much going on in such a short scene, so much emotion. And the score being played is immaculate. Easily my favorite and most heartbreaking scene in the whole movie.

When Marvel first started to roll out the idea of an extended universe (I literally had no idea who the Avengers were until someone mentioned it after the 1st Captain America), I started to learn more about the larger universe.   One of the constant comments I've heard about why DCEU has failed miserably while Marvel has flourished is that Marvel is connected to the real world and real world issues (NYC gets demolished, X-Men is an allegory to the civil rights movement, etc.). Beyond the artistic development of making it lighter and all that other jazz, the DCEU seems to have a very big disadvantage in that their superheroes are simply too powerful it seems.   As opposed to Spiderman, the X-Men, Iron Man, and Captain America who start off with very grounded villains before they go off into space, it seems as though DC heroes really have no capacity for that. Other than Batman, all of them are essentially gods and so the only true villain can be other gods - which of course feels like a reinforcement that Batman would be the most popular since it's the most grounded in its story.   So for those who are more deeply knowledgeable about the DC comics, what does a successful DCEU look like? What does DC have to do to keep the story grounded to make them more relatable while their most popular and/or notable heroes are gods amongst men who need gods to defeat them?"

I couldn't believe The Good Nurse sold me the easily likable Eddie Redmayne as a creepy, suspicious looking dude.  Aside from the performances, the drama was alright. The stakes were established very early on and the only question that remained from the start was the 'why' of the murders.  It the disappointment of some, we don't exactly get the answer to the 'why' of it but it is based on a true story and the culprit in real life never gave the reason as well.  But as the movie ended, I felt the why isn't always necessary.

Yes, I know the mere existence of Santa makes it a fantasy movie, but the mean principal was only 32 and lives in a gorgeous house. The average age of a principal in the US is 48. 32 isn't impossible, but certainly improbable.  Not only that, but she doesn't have money to spend on school decorations because this is a high performing school yet the staff Christmas party has massive elaborate decorations.   This is probably less probable than satan existing in real life. In less concerned about her house and more concerned about her job as a principle at age 32."

The movie starts with a team on an island or in some woods. They are there to study something (maybe an animal/species) there sometime in the late 1800's early 1900's and this part they are dressed from this time period and have a canvas tent set up. A machete gets stuck in the post of the tent at some point and the crew are killed or go missing.  The movie then shifts to modern day and people end up in this area maybe to go camping or exploring and come across the tent and the equipment with the machete still stuck in the post and they question it but soon they start to get picked off. They are getting hunted by something similar to the predator.  Spoiler ahead from the ending - >!The main character covers herself in some sludge related to the animals/aliens that allows her to become invisible to them or tolerable to them and allows her to either fight back or escape.!<"

But sci-fi could - and does - blend easily with other genres.  Just not as often, and I think that's unfortunate.  We could have more romance movies like Her or Your Name.  We could have more comedies like Weird Science or Multiplicity.  We could have more heart-warming dramas like Bicentennial Man or A.I.  We could have more sports movies like Real Steel.  Obviously sci-fi *does* move into these genres, but I would like to see it done more so that sci-fi doesn't immediately bring to mind action and fighting.  Edit:. Thank you all for the movie recs, but I am not looking for movies to watch, and I have seen almost everything mentioned so far.

The conversation goes much the same, but then after Toby's family leaves, both men realize there's nothing left to do but get on with it:  Toby watched the car leave the drive, the setting sun fading in and out of his peripheral vision as the movement of the pumpjack briefly obscured it, then let it shine through again. He closed his eyes, letting the light dance orange and red through the lashes. He slowly reached down, clicking off the shotgun's safety.  Slowly turning back toward Marcus, he sighed. “Well…”  He felt the warmth seeping from his chest before he even registered the two shots still echoing across the flat.  “Shit.”  Marcus stood there, a look of concern spreading across his face. “I expected you'd turn the other direction. I missed my spot a little bit. Sorry bout that.”  Toby grunted in pain and let out a bitter laugh. “Ain't that just my luck.” He fell to a knee, then flat on his back in the grass, looking at the sky through tears.  “Fuck. This hurts.”  “I know son. Breathe through it. Won't be too long.”  Marcus pulled out his cell phone and  started to dial 911.  “What you gonna tell 'em?” Toby gurgled.  “What happened,” Marcus choked out, pulling a tobacco pipe as the dispatcher answered. He gave the address, packed and lit the pipe. “They'll deal with me, I don't intend to fight it.”  Marcus looked down at the younger man dying in the grass of his childhood home.  “Your boys'll be fine. I'll see to it nobody messes with 'em out here.”  “Thanks,” Toby said, “they're better off anyway. Never….thought I was gonna get away with this. Never meant for people to -“  “I know, son,” Marcus said, lightly touching Toby's arm as he struggled to draw final breath. “I know.”  Final shot pans out over the horizon as we see two police cars and an ambulance racing toward the house with lights and sirens blaring.

So the only things you should criticize or praise about a movie that matters is both the cinematic and storytelling aspects of it.  I'm not saying you can't have a personal opinion about movies. I'm just saying don't let personal biases and agendas cloud your judgement when the discussion comes up about which movie is best/better. My favourite movies are Catch Me If You Can (Cuz I imagine myself as the protagonist) and Warrior (cuz of my brother and I's relationship). But I can easily recognize Shawshank Redemption and Fight Club as the objectively superior ones. And I think more people should differentiate their critical and personal opinions about entertainment products and come with 2 lists.   It's probably why my most critically acclaimed movie era is the late 80s, 90s and early 00s. Think about Shawshank Redemption, Forrest Gump, Fight Club, Se7en, Scarface, Silence Of The Lambs, The Green Mile and American Psycho among others. They're movies that weren't too modern that they fall under the trope of prioritizing spectacle or... ugh.. politics.. over story and characters but they also aren't too old fashioned that people who watch them fall under the trope of the nostalgia dilemma. I get that you can have a weak spot for a movie because of your life situation at the time of watching them (like with me and Warrior) or your hype at the time when it came out due to it breaking new grounds with special effects and cinematography and that's all very fair. But it sucks that these technically bias views on pieces of art reduces or outright debunks the credibility of the simply better executed movies premises because critical acclaim isn't placed where it's due.

Even the Squirrel Room and the Prince and his chocolate palace is from the book. And the Oompa Loompas were natives. The author's wife said that he would have loved this movie.          The first movie only uses 5% of the book and got the title wrong. Literally the only things in this movie that are in the book is the plot, 3 of the 4 factory rooms and the dramatic boat ride. Everything else was entirely made up and did not exist in the book. And instead of a room of squirrels with bad nuts, it was a room of geese with bad eggs.  Even the author of the book that had to write the script for this movie hated all of the changes.        I grew up watching both movies and loved them both, and at the time I didn't know that there was a book. When I read the book when I turned 12, I realized that they got the title wrong for the first movie, but not the second one. Then when reading the book, I realized that the second movie was exactly like the book. And afterwards I wondered why the first movie failed so much. And what is weird is that everyone I talked to about the second movie, they thought that I was crazy that I thought it was good. Apparently, everyone loves the first movie and hates the second one. Did no one read the book? Did anyone know that there was a book? I don't entirely hate the first movie. Comparing it to the book and then back to the second movie...it is pretty bad, but as a fantasy movie for its time, I guess its ok.      So why does this movie get so much hate, but everyone loves Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory?     Also, I do agree that Gene Wilder was the better Willy Wonka, but his movie is not the best of the two."

I was expecting a cute, funny and sentimental rom-com and while it's all of that, what I did not expect was to be utterly enthralled thanks to the chemistry between Adam Sandler and Drew Barrymore.  Never in my life have I believed a movie relationship more than I did when watching this. When they meet it's not like this big oh my god I love her moment, it's just a little brief friendly moment between coworkers. And then as they start to spend more time together you slowly see both of them start to fall for each other and it just feels so goddamn real because of how Sandler and Barrymore sell it.   And this all comes to a head with the big finale, which by every possible metric should be just a massive eyeroll. It involves a chase-down at the airport and a big confession of love in a public setting, all things I'd normally laugh at but my eyes were glued to the TV because I just bought into this fake relationship so much.  Anyways, they must really care about one another in real life because I really don't think you can fake love like that."

I only recommend this if you've already seen the rest of the list that touches on the theme of horror in the style of the thing.  **Train to Busan**  A classic if you are looking for zombies, I would say the best, except that they did the live action at the Seoul station, it is much superior in narrative but sadly it was a very bad animation.  **Screamers 1995**  killer robots hiding among humans for a surprise attack.  **The horder 2009**  It feels more immersive due to its more realistic tone in American gang-style conversation, sadly the action is a bit poor compared to its dialogue.  **what we become**  trapped in their houses by the restrictions of the military, a lot of suspense very good, it feels like a thread that is always on the verge of breaking, a total recommendation if you are looking for something dramatic, but it has a small problem, I feel like it is missing something of action or to show more horror.  **Survival of the dead**  If you're looking for more of a military perspective, this is a great option. I think they achieved their goal well by the way they acted and the strategies used.  **The Wailing**  Wonderful movie, again the Asians making masterpieces, I can only say that the tension that this movie gives is good because almost at no time is it tension of persecution but of suspicions, it focuses a lot on rituals so for lovers of portelgeist this is it That is a great recommendation from me.  **Cloverfield**  The only handheld movie that was worth seeing for me, what a good movie that constant tension and when the monster comes out it was something spectacular like never before, seriously if you haven't seen it yet you should see it, it's excellent although the beginning is slow.  **Apocalypse disaster L.A**  If you want something within a city, this captures that feeling quite well, but there is a problem, it is that the special effects are bad and they hardly show any places, it shows that they did it in about 4 very closed places without the opportunity to record in the street But for the rest, if we talk about narrative and acting, it's pretty good, nothing spectacular, but it's passable.  **Seoul Station**  very, very bad animation, it's not the worst either since it has good work in the shadows and everything happens at night which helps to enjoy it, in general I recommend it because it has one of my favorite narratives in movies.  &#x200B;  **- others -**  &#x200B;  **1.** **Groundhog Day**  My favorite comedy and romance, he repeats the day over and over again becoming an omniscient god, and I especially liked the message that the movie leaves, it makes me smile.  2. **Donnie darko**  It is a film that had a great impact on me because of the decision made by the protagonist, it made me cry inside.  3. **Montage 2013**  a good detective movie, redemption and above all revenge but with a touch less of action and more of the relationship of life, I put this in particular here because it is my mother's favorite, I will only say how bad it is it feels long  Pontypool 2008  If you are looking for a suspense movie where everything happens on the radio, this is excellent and >!especially that ending so strange and funny at the same time I loved it!<.  **The Butterfly Effect**  classic and the firecracker scene hit me hard, that still hits me to this day in my mind before I go to sleep.  **kiseijû part 1**  Another great live action that I highly recommend if you feel like all live action sucks, this is a great option to see that you can do very good things that don't focus on comedy.  **Signs**  It is already a classic that everyone should know, quite dramatic and with great scenes that stay in the memory, but I feel that something is missing.  **A day**  the day repeats itself and he must save his daughter, quite dramatic but I feel that the plot in the end fell short and lacked polishing.  **museum**  Good movie about a detective and a serial killer.  **The Happening  2008**  I don't have much to say, it's fine but I don't like the relationship of the main characters at all, I feel that it becomes somewhat uncomfortable.  **Valhalla rising**  The Voyage of a Viking is the one I enjoy the most of the Viking-style movies, it has almost no narrative and is especially focused on silence and long walks and deep gazes, in a very barbaric style.  **Black death**  If you prefer something more European medieval style and not so Viking, this is my recommendation. A witches and knights film with a dark but realistic tone, it is not for everyone.  **delicatessen**  The weirdest movie I've ever seen but without losing its charm, I recommend it. It doesn't sound like a song made into a movie.  **When Nietzsche Wept**  You are looking for philosophy, this is my personal recommendation, I haven't seen many on philosophy, really, or rather I didn't find a good one, it doesn't satisfy my desire for philosophy, but it's passable and entertaining, the only bad thing is that it has very strange scenes which can be uncomfortable to watch with a lot of people.  **20th century boys part 2**  great villain, very good villain, I adore the scenes of this villain, that's all I can say about this movie, the rest is passable but the villain is the best of this movie and also of the manga honestly.  **9 2009**  This rather dark animated film marked my childhood, hidden among the children's films, this film clearly for adults with a lot to say about life.  **Poultrygeist**  If you want a movie that is the king of disgust, this is a classic that goes from looking for the record to the most disgusting of the cinema, and it succeeds, but that does not mean that it stops being entertaining and hilarious.  &#x200B;  **-honorific mention -**  &#x200B;  **Night of the creeps**  I didn't like the movie at all but what a great ending, it made me want to know what was there, what it was, I never imagined that I wanted a continuation of a movie that I didn't like hahaha."

        "body": "​Very few things I've watched over the years have had enough of an impact that I can say they “changed me” but Candyman from 1992 is one of those movies. Yes, it absolutely scared the hell out of me but it also made me a lifelong fan of all things horror. Books, movies, comics, if it leans horror I'm in, let's do it. If you watched the horror films I've consumed back to back it would take you literally years to finish the binge, it's that serious of a problem. Maybe it's more of a condition.  I was young, eight years old, when I first watched Candyman and the effects were almost instant, I say almost because for nearly a week I couldn't go to the bathroom if I was the only one awake. I couldn't walk past the bathroom mirror to get to the toilet if I didn't know there was someone who could potentially rescue me, or at least distract the monster while I got away. I was an only child so I was a bit selfish. You have to remember though, at this point in my life the scariest movie I had come in contact with was probably, Who Framed Roger Rabbit, and let's face it, that movie was also scary as hell.  I didn't get to see Candyman when it first came out—I grew up in a small town and the nearest theater was a couple of hours away—but we did have a Blockbuster Video, and we did, just about every weekend, take advantage of the (five movies, five nights, five dollars) deal that they offered. Going to the video store to pick out movies was a huge part of my childhood, some of my favorite memories are tied to that place. I learned a lot about myself by finding things I loved, and even things I absolutely hated, at a very young age. I've talked a lot about art before, art can teach you a lot about yourself if you're willing to listen.  So why did Candyman scare the hell out of me and how did that make me fall in love with horror? Well, one thing at a time. It scared the hell out of me for the obvious reasons, Tony Todd was a monster straight out my nightmares. The grimy coat, the meat hook constantly dripping blood, even his damn voice. If I hear that voice to this day I'll shudder. It probably didn't hurt that the summer before I watched Candyman I found out I was allergic to bees when I got stung on my eyelid and had to be rushed to the hospital. Then there was Virginia Madsen just selling the hell out of every scene she was in. When she was confident I felt confident. When she was scared I was terrified. She did an amazing job.  Bernard Rose wrote and directed the movie, it was top tier in my opinion from front to back. Of course it wasn't until years later when I was older and deep into my horror obsession that I found out all of this is Clive Barker's fault, the movie is based on his short story called, The Forbidden, an excellent read on its own. Candyman only went on to make about $25.8 million in the US on a budget of $30 million, but international and video sales kept it from being a bust.  For the second part of the question, how did it make me fall in love with horror, well, I didn't know movies could make me feel things like that so strongly. I was scared to death even though I knew it wasn't real, it made me believe those things were actually happening. It made me anxious. It made me generally worried for the people Tony Todd was after. I love all film genres but others fail to make me react with as many emotions as horror in such a short period of time. I think it's chasing that high, horror for me is like riding a roller coaster, you know it's safe (or hope it is) but you do it anyway for that adrenaline rush. I fell in love with the genre for that reason, I can get that feeling without ever having to leave my house and be around other humans, it's a beautiful thing.  By now I think I've made it pretty clear how I feel about horror and in my opinion there still hasn't been a movie to live up to Candyman (1992). It's pure terror wrapped in a neat 99 minute package that makes you feel all the feels. A perfect film and the perfect place to start for anyone who wants to have a reason to not look in the mirror for a while, as if I needed another.  Twitter/Instagram | CrockettForReal"

That kind of sent me down a rabbit hole - I've known all the lore around the tension and differences between the Stephen King book and the Stanley Kubrick movie, but have never read the book myself.  So I read it, and then immediately read Doctor Sleep as well.    A quick summation of my thoughts on both the films and books:   The Shining is a great book, faulty book to film adaptation, and a Masterpiece film.   Doctor Sleep is a really great book, largely faithful book to film adaptation, good movie, AND a successful sequel to the 1980 film.    That last part I think is the most interesting - given the distinction between the King book and the  Kubrick movie, I think the greatest feat of Doctor Sleep as a film that it seems to function well as a sequel to both without very many issues, IMO.    TL; DR: The Shining/Doctor Sleep films and books provide a fascinating study of the process of book to film adaptation.    Curious to hear others thoughts, as well as likes/dislikes within the books and films."

        "body": "Despite its underperformance at the box office (in large part due to the poor timing of release & lack of adequate advertising by the studio, and controversies surrounding one of it's leads), Spielberg's West Side Story is one of the best films I've seen in years and I feel that it surpasses the 1961 version in every way. While you could argue that it did receive an adequate amount of attention as it received numerous awards and nominations, it appears to me that the majority of the movie-going public has not yet seen the film.  With this reimagining, I feel Spielberg brings his magic touch of telling a story on a massive scale while also making it deeply personal. Not only is the story presented in a way that is moving and endearing, but it's cast is incredible and the cinematography and lighting are phenomenal. Spielberg's version of circa 1957-58 New York City is almost magical in the sense that it's the New York that may have never actually existed but one that exists in our collective cultural mindset. Additionally, I have a great appreciation for the modifications made to this film from its source material, whether the order and context of songs having been reorganized, the dance and fight choreography feeling more 'real,' the casting of actual Latin American and Hispanic actors, and the expansion of and flushing out of certain characters, such as Anybody's (also enjoyed the changing of Doc to Valentina as not only a way to include Rita Moreno but also as a way to create a new character and explore new themes). While I think West Side Story is a pretty timeless story that holds up well no matter how it's presented, their's something special about this film - I'm not a massive musical theater or movie- musical fan by any means, but something about this one just really stuck with me!  What are your thoughts? Do you think West Side Story didn't get the credit it deserved? Do you think it will become more popular or culturally significant with time? I've never created a conversation/open dialogue thread on Reddit like this so I'm really interested to hear what people have to say!"

They came out in the early 2000s but they hold up against a much improved (production value wise) action industry of the modern day.   Besides their excellent use of shakey cam (which apon rewatch felt a little overexaggerated perhaps with my perception affected by its later overuse) and genral trend setting, the pacing is well done its unbelievable. Never am i bored, between car chases, peak fight choreography, and intriguing dialog.  However, the thing that really stood out to me most on rewatch was the sound design. The sound track is exceptional. But the moments without any music are probably the best. The fights feel so crunchy from the sounds. And the guns feel so... i cant find the word. The sound plays a huge factor in how these hold up.  What do you think? Product of their time or timeless action classics?"

        "body": "As many people continue to use and rely on Rotten Tomatoes to get a sense of how good a movie is and to often decide whether a movie is worth seeing or not, I think it's important to remind people that the Rotten Tomato score is not calculated as probably most people assume it is. Let's get into it:  Most people perceive it as a movie that has a 99% rating on RT means that the movie is reviewed as outstanding with a score of 9.9 on 10 or 99 on 100 for example. But it actually doesn't mean this at all.   Likewise, people often assume as RT critic rating of 50% as being on fairly poorly rated movie with a score of 5 on 10 or 50 on 100, whereas again, this is completely inaccurate.   I score of 99% means that 99% of the reviews were positive reviews. The reviews all could all have said things along the line of “a fairly good movie..” and it would be treated as a positive review. This doesn't discriminate between a review saying that the movie was fairly good and a review saying that it was the best movie of the century. Both are treated as just a positive review. So a 99% rating on RT in no way means the movie was outstanding. In fact, 99% of the reviewers could have given it a score of 7/10 and it the RT rating would be 99%.   The same applies for a movie with a 50% rating. 50% of the reviewers might have said that the movie is the best piece of work of all time, and 50% of the reviewers saying it was a fairly poor movie. If 50% of reviewers gave the movie a 10 on 10 score and the other 50% gave the the movie a 5 on 10 score, then the average scoring would be 7.5 on 10 and actually better than the movie that had a 99% on RT."

And I want to clarify that these aren't bad guys that happen to be English or portrayed by English actors. Our heroes are fighting the British Empire itself, and the baddies are an extension of that.  Similarly, American movies that take place in different time periods face similar foes. Revolutionary War movies also face off against the British Empire. WWII movies face off against Nazis. Cold War era movies face off against Russians/Soviets.  But what are some movies where Americans are the bad guys?  Edit: Lot of comments mentioning films that feature American protagonists who do morally questionable things.

Upon the moment of their death, the suit consumes its current host entirely. Upon being put on by the next unsuspecting victim, the parasite permanently binds to the new host, takes them over, and endows them with the power of Santa. This enables and perpetuates Christmas and its associated magic. The suit does this without consideration for the host. Once put on, the host's fate is sealed.  The suit is so powerful that it creates and sustains every aspect of the Christmas magic we see. It's possible that the suit can even create life. Were the elves living the in North Pole before the very first Santa, or did the suit create them for its purposes? Flying reindeer, same thing. Did the suit force the elves to build Santa's workshop in the middle of a frozen tundra? It's possible that the entire North Pole is a manifestation of over a millennium of work by the suit.  Going further, without the suit, there is no Santa. And without Santa, there is no Christmas. However, in the brief period between consuming the deceased Santahost and Tim Allen putting the suit on, Christmas does not cease to exist. This means that the suit doesn't necessarily need a host to sustain it's magical power, it simply needs them to move. Therefore being the source of all Christmas magic, it's reasonable to believe that if the SantaSuit was ever successfully destroyed (if that's even possible) then Christmas would cease to exist.  And finally, every Santahost is doomed to the same fate - eventual total consumption by the suit upon their moment of death. Which poses serious spiritual considerations. When the dead Santahost is consumed, is their soul also consumed by the suit? Devoured? Spirited away?  And the suit has been doing this for over 1,200 years (Judy the elf's age). How many victims has the suit claimed? Is that how it sustains its power? Does it grow in strength with each meal?  And what is the suit's purpose? What does it want and where did it come from? Without answers, this is the only logical conclusion."

And you can feel him pushing through all of that because he has to retrieve the dog. Period.   We do not get enough heroes conveying that they are ANSOLUTELY terrified but have a thing they need to do regardless of all of that. To be that's the epitomy of heroism.  Ellen Ripley in ALIENS was another excellent example of this at the as she goes to retrieve Newt.

Granted, Spielberg has enormous talent as a director but I honestly can't picture any of his great movies (Jaws, Close Encounters, Indiana Jones, Jurassic Park, E.T.) without hearing Williams' music in my head. Jaws in particular works so successfully due to it's music, the fact that this was Spielberg's breakout success just makes me wonder how the film would have landed without it's iconic score. And granted, Williams had already produced several soundtracks prior to working on Jaws, so maybe they just brought out the best in one another and it's truly hard to separate which component benefited more from their collaboration. Like Danny Elfman and Tim Burton or in the sports world Joe Montana and Jerry Rice. Just thought it was an interesting conversation worth having."

While they definitely appear to be upper-class, they are **NOT** the ones gifting a Paris trip for the entire McCallister family.  It is Peter's brother, who is living in Paris, that is paying for the McCalilister family to fly out there.  Kevin's Mom explains it to Harry (dressed as a cop), in the opening scene.  > My husband's brother transferred to Paris last summer and both of his kids are still going to school here, and I guess he missed the whole family.  He's giving us all this trip to Paris for the holidays, so we can be together.   Now, in Home Alone 2, it does appear that Kevin's parents are the ones who pay for the family to fly down to Florida.  Uncle Frank mentions it when scolding Kevin:     > Don't wreck my trip.  Your dad's paying good money for it.   So, just wanted to clarify things because most people often incorrectly assume Kevin's dad is the one paying for everyone in the first movie.   **EDIT:**  A lot of people either didn't read the post or missed the point completely.  I'm not saving the McCallisters aren't wealthy, they obviously are.  I'm saying they are not the ones who paid for the Paris trip, which many people just assume they did.  Yeah this fact has nothing to do with the story, it's just an observation of mine and a movie-detail mistake I often see people making."

So what are some docs you liked? Doesn't have to be a movie necessarily. Whether it be crime or conspiracy or nature or whatever.  Personally I like docs on large things, I haven't seen a whole lot of them but crime docs are just a whole lot more common. But This is a Robbery would be my favorite. The crime and story is so amazing. Delving into the mafia as well was also interesting.  Edit: Just watched Sasquatch on Hulu and it's amazing. Goes a lot deeper and more fucked up than I ever thought a Bigfoot story could go."

Indeed, I am not sure I have ever really read it, it may have just been an abridged version for kids.  Either way, though, does this movie not omit a ton from the book? Does it not alter its message?  For example. I believe there was a scene of Pinocchio being hanged. I don't recall it being featured in the film.  The book's message was a warning to young kids that they must not disobey their elders. In this movie, Pinocchio never does anything wrong. The only time he disobeys his Papa is when he goes with Il Conte Volpe, but he does not do that out of malice of ill will. How is that consistent with the tone of the book, which was a warning not to misbehave?   Please don't be rude, I am, quite simply, curious if anybody else has noticed it, and whether I might be wrong."

And how come after the bombs, everything went against Snow?( I know he mentioned it [the whole Coin set the bombs and it was filmed], but hasnt he done worse things and still retained power? Except for the rebels of course) - So, Gale knew about the bombs all along?, Was Gale aware of Coin's plan all this while? What if the bomb killed both of them? - Why was Katniss allowed to go home? - Do the games continue after this? Or did peace eventually start to reign? - ^^ Did the rebellion stop? Do the districts now live in harmony? Or there is no peace in Ba Sing Se?

Goldeneye is fantastic to me mostly because of its excellent pacing.  The slower parts aren't super long or drawn out, they're actually interesting and not overly sefl-indulgent (like the newer Craig movies).  The plotline is interesting but also simple enough to follow, and the cast isn't explaining the story to us.  Basically, it FEELS like a bond movie.  Its over the top, pithy, witty, has great car chases and shooting scenes, captures and escapes, huge explosions and tons of close calls.  Its kinda goofy like the older ones, but also pretty edgy and gritty.  To me its the perfect Bond movie.  To give context, my next favourites include Skyfall, The Man with the Golden Gun and TWINE....oh and I also enjoyed both Timothy Dalton Bond movies, and I wish he'd made 1 or 2 more.  He was the first 'gritty' Bond.  least favourite/ worst Bond is also a Brosnan (Die another Day)  there's some bad aspects in old Connery / Moore movies but at least they weren't try-hards like with DaD...  &#x200B;  Actually someone else suggested this, whats you're favourite bond movie per each actor?"

However, a number of horror movies seem to fit this mold, including The Cabin in the Woods (pure comedy into horror-comedy) or The Evil Dead II.  Any other movies that masterfully handle what should be a jarring transition? In the realm of horror movies, are there any examples of romantic comedies that turn into horror? I was struck by what Jordan Peele said about how comedy and horror often hit the same sort of beats and hinge on successfully flipping expectations in order to be effectively funny/scary, which is why they blend so well together."

Let's be honest, this isn't a controversial opinion or a hard case to make and probably has little pushback but I think the first Pixar movie still hasn't been topped in all these years by any studio.   The animation for its time was groundbreaking and seeing it around release was an unforgettable experience. I had seen The Lion King the previous year and that looked ancient in comparison. But that isn't the reason why Toy Story is the greatest animated movie of all time.   The story, memorable characters (Rex with his inferiority complex and non-confrontational nature, Buzz's Space Ranger obliviousness, Woody's jealousy at a new toy possibly replacing him and acting out, Mr. Potato Head's surliness, Slinky's loyalty etc.), emotional resonance, voice cast, animation, music, humor that appeals to all ages and the timeless nature of it. Some of the most memorable dialogue and one of the best buddy duos on screen ever. Other movies have many of these qualities as well, but Toy Story does it the best, in my opinion.  Every second literally counts (81 minutes) and there is no wasted motion. It is fast, explosive, perfectly written, funny, tense, full of character and takes a lot of risks with the premise and focusing on non-human characters and delivers on everything it promises.  The sequels were excellent (especially 2 and 3) but I don't think you can enjoy them as much unless you've seen the first because it depends on those original characters being established.

Just for the discussion, let's call the Omega the universe in which the Evelyn from the prelude (everything before the Part I - Everything title) lives.     So, what I get is that the Omega timeline is the one in which the fanny pack fight happens, in which Bagel Deirdre (verse jumped into Omega Deirdre) leaps at the staircase, and where Omega Waymond gets stabbed with the glass shard by Evelyn.     Also, I understand that Omega Evelyn is the Evelyn version that is the only Evelyn mind we follow in the movie (always verse jumped into each universe's Evelyn) - except, perhaps, during the flashbacks - it is blind singer Evelyn's mind who was into blind singer Evelyn's body when she pierced her own eyes.      I also get that the reconciliation scene between Evelyn and Joy near the end of Everything is not happening in the Omega universe. It is happening in one of the new year party universes.     But whose minds are the ones of Evelyn and Joy in that scene? I guess they are Omega Evelyn (who was the one Evelyn who evolved to become universally aware like Jobu Tupaku), and Alpha Joy (aka Jobu). Because that scene serves as the step for Jobu's spiritual pacification which led to her extending her hand out of the bagel or, in other words, reaching out to be saved.     But if that's the case, they are not mother and daughter, right?     On the other hand, when they verse jump they get the memories, experiences, skills and emotions from their versions they accessed. So it could be seen as if they are not only accessing their other selves, but that they are melding with them (well, what are our minds if not the set of our memories, experiences, skills and emotions?). So, in light of that, can we conclude that it doesn't matter if it was Alpha Evelyn or Omega Evelyn the one at the end, they were all one?     And the final scene at the non-destroyed IRS building... I understand that it is a universe other than Omega, right? And we are looking at Alpha Joy and Omega Evelyn at the end too, right?"

At the end of the movie when Lorenzo was standing in front of sonny's casket with C I actually expected him to open up to C and confess to having a history with sonny but decided to go straight after he was born.

I have been a long time fan of Kevin Smith, more recently more of an apologist of his latter work. I can recognize his films of the last decade have been controversial and more miss than hit. Though I don't let that detract from the great work the man has brought to us. He seems to be in a phase where he is more self serving with fanfare and inside jokes than producing empathetic and relatable storytelling he was known for.  All that being said, I have been excited for the prospect of a Clerks 3 for YEARS (honestly after the credits rolled on the second). I know Smith has rewrote it many times, with original actors signing on and then back off, putting it in a limbo. So I was definitely glad when he finally said Clerks 3 was written and about to officially begin Pre-Production. Time has passed and we were given our first trailer and I was a bit more hesitant on the quality, seems to reflect more of his current work than his past, but I love the series and was still excited to give it a go.  **REVIEW**  I am now in a post-Clerks 3 work and I can happily say the ride has been worth it. You can tell Smith wanted to covey the maturity he has gone through, especially after his heart attack, and portray that accurately with his characters. The acting with every one is a bit meh, especially Randal's performance, but I was able to overlook it. It kinda felt like a low production play which I think provided much of its charm in the long run. Spoiler here - >!I wasn't a big fan of what they did with Rosario Dawson's character in the beginning. But I think it paid off in the end. I just wish they could've done something a bit different with her character.!<  I laughed a lot. I cried a bit. Then I laughed some more. It is a beautiful full circle film that closes the Clerks storyline in a appropriate and succinct manner. Spoiler here - >!when Randal shows Dante the first cut of the movie. And it jumps to the movie theater where Dante is watching Clerks 1. I was blubbering like a baby. You could feel this is coming straight from Kevin Smith in his vulnerable moments during his own heart attack. !<  I would rate each film as such: Clerks 1 - 9/10. Clerks 2 - 8/10. Clerks 3 - 7/10. Clerks 3 is weakest of the trilogy, but it also has some great strengths, particularly during the final act of the movie.  **CONCLUSION**  I would highly recommend the movie to the fans of Clerks, it's a must. To classic Smith fans, it's also a must. Tons of cameos and callbacks to other films in the universe. For average movie goers, it depends on your affinity to the series and director as of late. You might find more misses than hits, but I think most people can agree it was a decent send off."

I really can't stand the dialogue from the duo of Stephen McFeely and Christopher Markus in particular. Especially because it really ruins what are otherwise awesome movies.  I also just watched The Gray Man and couldn't help but think how the dialogue completely sank what could have been a pretty solid movie.  If you think of a writer with a similar style to Tarantino, Crowe, or the Coens, please comment a few of their movies too!  Edit:  even though he only has a few movies under his belt, I think a hidden gem is Ben Affleck. I really liked the dialogue in Goodwill Hunting, Gone Baby Gone, and The Town.

Neeson can't do this forever; who's the next solid, liked, sort of thrillery actor who should pivot to making entertaining schlock? Or is that era coming to an end?  The actor shouldn't be much older than 50; there's only so much that can be done when an actor surpasses sixty. Russell Crowe is now too old, I think.  I nominate Aaron Paul; has the likeability, can use another win after minor roles here and there and the canceled West World. Still in his forties, but he's getting there - better start youngish."

The leading female roles are played by Michelle Monaghan and Liana Liberato to portray the same character at different ages, but the actresses literally have different colored eyes and it's all I can see. But at least they somewhat look alike because the leading male roles are played by people who look nothing alike. Not a huge thing… I just feel this kind of movie almost needs that type of casting for it to flow and make sense. 2) I don't remember it being this cringey?! Maybe it's because I was younger the first time I watched it. Or maybe it's the acting? I can't tell. James Marsden is great and always is but, idk. I read the book and honestly loved the plot so not sure why it was cringey on screen.  That's it. Really I came here to say the eye color thing really annoyed me.   If you have watched this recently, what's your take on it?"

        "body": "Greetings! Recently I watched Miracle on 34th Street (1947) and it struck me how much my perspective has changed since I used to watch this movie as a kid. Two major aspects of this movie really stuck out to me while watching as an adult that I just totally accepted as normal as a kid.  First, Mr. Gailey as a protagonist... I used to really like this character and just assumed that he was a 100% good person that just wanted to spread love and joy and all the other intangibles. However, I see him now as kind of slimey. The fact that he openly admits to being nice to Susan to try and pursue a relationship with Mrs. Walker is kind of off-putting (not to mention he takes Susan to the Zoo without Ms. Walker even knowing about it, but the house maid so knew so I guess it's ok), but what really annoys me is how Mr. Gailey takes Susan to see Santa after Mrs. Walker explicitly told him she doesn't want Susan to be influenced by ideas that she sees as fantasy. To me, it would be the equivalent of a parent raising their kids to be athiest, and then someone comes along and takes their kids to church without getting the consent of the parent first. Mr. Gailey basically walks into Susan and Doris' lives and tries to enforce his world view onto them.   The other aspect of the movie that doesn't sit right is when Kris Kringle hits Mr. Sawyer with the cane. As a kid, it felt good to see this prick, Sawyer, get his comeuppance, but as an adult, I realize Kris Kringle not only lost the argument by getting physical first but he also validated part of Saywers concern that he was apt to become violent. Granted, it was for a different reason, but ultimately Kris did become violent first and then the movie glosses over that while still expecting you to feel sympathy for Kringle. If Kringle had just went to Mr. Macy originally like he said he was going to do without getting violent he wouldn't even have ended up in Bellvue and there wouldn't have been a commitment hearing in the first place.   So yeah, I still love this movie, still makes me laugh and smile but I have to put myself back in my childhood state of mind and turn off my cynical critic side."

Affleck goes from leader/calm/ super planner/ conservative to plan sabotaging/ willing to kill anyone the moment he sees all the cash.

The film starts with a knight leading up to the top of the tower where Fiona stands. Thinking he's her true love, she tries to kiss him, but is interrupted when she notices the sun setting down. In an unsettling fashion, she begins to quickly transform into her ogre form. We get a quick glimpse of her face, and it's a much more deformed and horrifying appearance compared to the original film. Her voice becomes more masculine and frightening. When the knight attempts to flea, you can hear her cry KISS ME! YOU HAVE TO KISS ME! KISS ME MY SWEET PRINCE. It almost sounds like a cry for help. Suddenly the knight trips on a leftover corpse in the hall, and while pausing, he hears the same uncanny voice shout COME BACK!. He continues to pause, when suddenly the green monster begins to run toward his direction. Rather than getting up to run again, he accepts his fate, but is surprised to hear chewing sounds from her finishing off the leftover corpse. He slightly tilts, as if he is attempting to escape, but the ogre immediately notices. The film ends with her grunting toward the camera, and the credits begin to play with a slow cover of All-star playing in the background.  I personally don't really like the concept of turning children's media into horror films. I don't mind making things edgier, like the Samurai Jack revival, but making a full on horror film, to me, is the equivalent of a traumatizing porn parody. I know that makes me kind of sound like a puritan, but it's just my opinion. I'm not demanding a ban or anything on this type of content.  I also think the quality of most of these films have been absolute garbage. The Banana Splits Movie is just a cheap FNAF rip off with horrible acting (I really hate the title too because it implies that this isn't a parody, but rather the same universe as the original series). The Mean One, which is a Grinch parody film, also has garbage acting and just a frustratingly bad script. And while it hasn't been released yet, Winnie The Pooh: Blood & Honey also looks very cheap and has a story that doesn't sound very fleshed out at all. I'm sure the upcoming Bambi won't be anything special either.  Before I saw this Fiona film, I thought the trend of horror adaptations based on children's media was just going to become the next generation of bad creepypastas. It's kind of funny looking back on those now, and the campiness of how scared everyone was of them during a time when it was new, and the internet couldn't easily contact creators of shows/movies to debunk this nonsense like they can now. Now we have a couple of REAL horror films and... in my opinion, they're not scary or interesting.  Fiona however is absolutely the best one in my opinion. For starters, unlike the previous horror movies that try to create new generic stories, this film is based off of an actual fan theory involving the character. Before this film released, people speculated that the knights in the original Shrek movie were actually remains that Fiona ate. Think about it. She was locked up in the tower, probably doesn't have access to food, and she's probably traumatized and struggling to balance her new ogre-self, and her human self. Think of it kind of like The Hulk (ironic I know. Green people). Ogres also traditionally eat humans in fairy tales. People have speculated that this is the real reason why Fiona's father locked her in the tower. To protect her from other people. The dragon was just a warning to prevent people from entering. As for The Fairy Godmother (who worked with her father) and Prince Charming, many people believe that the Godmother is secretly the witch who casted the spell on Fiona or was at least involved with that situation (she literally owns a factory where she invents magic and potions), and she ensured that Charming would have been immune to Fiona's actions. Shrek didn't eat humans because he just wanted to be left alone. He was BORN an ogre so he likely found an alternative for eating, such as cooking swamp animals, and didn't commit to any violent tendencies toward actual people. But to Fiona, it's just an affliction that takes over her every night. She can't control it. Shrek, a FULL-ON, probably helped her control it when he came into her life.  I know to some of y'all this sounds dumb, but people have fun writing these theories.  This short film is such a twisted and neat display of that idea. The people who made this were clearly fans of the source material if they were willing to create a movie based on this. The creators consider this movie, based on Shrek lore. I felt so bad for Fiona because she's clearly desperate to be normal again and would kiss any man who steps near her just to go back to having a normal non-isolated where she can no longer hurt others. Again, this is not my thing personally, but I can see why to some, it's cool to see a horror adaptation of this idea. The only problem I have with this film is that it doesn't make much sense as to why the knight doesn't fight back. He's literally carrying a sword, and risked his life getting there. And why doesn't he continue running after tripping? Why does he just decide well I guess I'll just die when Fiona's running after him? Kind of bad writing there, but otherwise, very interesting.  This could be the next generation of creepypasta. Having actual professional short movies based on fan theories. I wouldn't really want to see these as full feature length films because I feel like many of them wouldn't be able to manage for over an hour. But having shorts seem like a very satisfying concept for people who want to see these theories in a visual medium. Because of its length, these wouldn't have to be major big budgeted films either, but could still have passion and effort put into them."

Then the artists themselves  re-recorded their original tracks and ultimately, the actors ended up having to be reduced to lip syncing. Regardless if the actor approved of it or not, why not offer a different audio track on a Blu-ray or digital extra so a viewer could actually hear the actor doing the songs?? Why can't we, the audience, get to hear them and decide which we prefer?  I think it would be an awesome extra to have and see how well they did. I think films like the Buddy Holly story are the best in the genre for the very reason that the actor is singing the songs.   What say you?"

I have high respect for this movie, and I have so many good memories associated with it.  Bomb City (2017) was an indie film about my city, and was partially filmed in my city.  The premise, at it's core, is so simple.  Punks vs. Jocks, (No spoilers!)  I find it very personal due to the fact that I just left high school, was going to college for film, and was a very good movie made in my home town.  That and it was contrivercial as fuck when it came out.  No one talked about it, and no one really does.    Night of the Living Dead (1960) started my love for horror, and The Exorcist (1973) only expanded it.  But my real intro to a horror movie as a concept was The Texas Chainsaw Massacre (1973/2003.)  I went to an elementary school in the middle of a trailer park around the time the prequel to the 2003 film came out.  All the tougher redneck kids were talking about how awesome the movie was, trying to look cool.  I wanted to fit in, but admittedly, my parents were pretty sensible not to let me see it.  But then I saw it on YouTube when I was 13 or 14, back when people uploaded whole movies to YouTube in parts.  But funny enough, people thought it was lame by the time I had saw it.    Titanic (1997) was my first kind of mature movie.  Like, it felt grown up to see this movie, but as I grew up, I fell out of love with James Cameron's film, and fell into love with the 1958 film, A Night to Remember.  Honestly, I love both of them equally, but props to Titanic for sparking my interest.  Anyway, that's enough from me, what are some personal favorites for you and why?"

How would Commodus talking to her son reveal anything about the plan and make Commodus suspicious? He wouldn't even know anything about the plan, being a child and all.   Finding out about the escape just felt really forced. Still enjoy the movie a lot though, just was wondering if anyone else had any input on this moment in the film.  Edit: this article on medium.com explains the point better than I do.   “Commodus has discovered his sister Lucilla's secret feelings about Maximus, as well as her desire to oust him from his imperial position in order to reestablish Rome as a republic. As such, he is now indirectly threatening her son Lucius — thus terrifying her into spilling the beans about the plan underway against him — so he can squash these plans and ensure total command over his empire.  But do you also remember how he happened to find this out, mere minutes before the scene? Um… Lucius told him, by shouting out for all the world to hear that he wanted to be “Maximus, The Savior of Rome!” To which Commodus then naturally queried “Who said that?”  The scene cuts next to Lucilla entering the palace after her plotting, before coming upon her terribly vexed brother, who's now menacing both her and her child. This practically screams that it was Lucius's own mother who told him Maximus was here to save Rome. To which, when I watched the scene this last time, I responded with an actual, audible “WHY?! Why would she do that?!”  Because what do we know about Lucilla by this point in the story? We know from her father that she's wise; we know from Maximus that she has a “talent for survival;” we know from her own mouth that she's been living in a “prison of fear” since her brother became emperor and has only visibly gone along with him to save her son, whose safety is obviously paramount to her.  So then why in blue perfect hell would she tell him Maximus was the “Savior of Rome?” Why would this protective mother endanger her own son like that? Why would this talented survivor confide a secret THIS HUGE in a child, especially one that's around the Emperor so frequently? Why would someone this wise now jeopardize the plan she had — up to this point — so cautiously crafted in such a careless, idiotic way for no reason at all?  Plainly put: She wouldn't. That scene makes no sense whatsoever, given the pre-existing reality of the movie.”  Edit: some of y'all really need to take the nostalgia goggles off and admit when something is flawed, which is ok because it's still a fantastic movie."

EDIT: I know Marvel wasn't doing all, but I didn't find many movies that I really liked the last few years. I watch movies from all around the world, and even that it was difficult, apart from Parasites, Joker, The Lighthouse or Roma, FOR ME, the rest of the films worldwide were pretty mediocre."

The script was 2 pages long and the rest padding. The movie was to ambitious for what it really was.   There can be so many interpretations while none of them being right at the same time. As a film it completely failed and doesnt deserve the praise it gets. This film feels its geared more for a nitch audience thats likes looking into things to a microscopic level so they can argue amongst themselves on how they're view on the movie is right and the others wrong. In a casual viewing sense this movie makes no sense and its shit. If you can skip the first 30 minutes and not miss anything them you failed somewhere."

        "body": "I first watched the 1998 version a long time ago as a kid and mostly forgot about it. I recently rewatched it again and now I can't stop.   First, let me start by saying this movie is full of romantic comedy tropes, has several large plot holes (would parents in London really send their 11-year olds alone to an 8-week summer camp in Maine?), and has some dialogue that is so cloying it makes my teeth hurt. Plus the entire premise of twin babies being permanently isolated from each other forever because of divorcing parents is cruel at best and downright criminal at worst.   But despite all that, this movie is so adorable and wholesome that it's become a comforting experience that makes my heart so happy the entire runtime. If I've had a bad day, I can watch it to make me feel better. Heartbroken? Straight to it. It's a simple but endlessly rewatchable film for me.   Some of the things I love about this movie:  * Lindsay Lohan, full stop. She is an incredible child actress in this. The fact that an eleven year old can play two distinct characters, one of which has an accent, and then play the characters playing themselves again, is kind of mind boggling. A really good adult actor would have a hard time with that, and she pulls it off so wonderfully. She is adorable, has some incredible facial acting, and is completely the heart and soul of the movie.  * This movie has a lot of tropes but it also subverts them in good ways too. My favorite parts of the movie are when the girls' true identity is revealed to their parents/caretakers. There is no anger or frustration at all, simply amazement and joy at being reunited with what they thought they had lost forever, and that never fails to make me go all teary.  * The butler/nanny characters are not only some welcome comedic relief but do a good job of showing how they acted as the surrogate for the lost parent for each of the twins and made sure they grew up relatively normal. They are both also a big reason this film has such a big heart.  * The two parents played by Natasha Richardson (RIP 🙁) and Dennis Quaid actually have a lot of chemistry on screen, which is critical, but just as important is their parental chemistry with the two girls, which is also abundant and heartwarming.  * This is a Disney romantic comedy so of course there is going to be a happy ending, but it actually feels earned. The parents get back together but it's not a flip of the switch thing. In fact there are several false starts and it seems like they have failed only to succeed based on a shared mutual past and love of their children. As a parent myself, I find extra happiness in the ending, if nothing else for the sake of the girls.   This movie is not perfect by any means but it has a lot of soul and I just love it to death. If you've never seen it before, don't expect a masterpiece but give it a chance and I think you'll find it as cute and heartwarming as I do."

True Romance had that one scene where Patricia Arquette gets beat down by one of the baddies, and how it was shot to the acting, along with the music choice made it surreal.  Same goes for the ending to Man on Fire. Similar to how Gladiator used that Irish singer for conveying the feels, Man on Fire is equally as moving/sad.  Top Gun also is/was a monumental film judging by how Top Gun 2s opening is nearly identical, as a kind of homage to Tony. Tony went against Paramount execs decisions, went against the grain and we end up getting Top Gun, one of the most beautifully shot action and aerial film ever.

        "body": "Okay, I know a lot were against the movie drifting from the original ending and usually I would agree. However, I think the movie actually made a better ending by fulfilling what Kate wanted all along. She had spent almost her entire life in hospitals, going through surgery after surgery. She knew the pressure it was putting on her family and on herself and she was tired of it. Her sister was created to be essentially spare parts and her brother was nonexistent in her mother's eyes. By letting go and forcing her family to do the same, she was giving them a chance at normality. Her parents would no longer be at odds with each other every time they forced Anna through another surgery and could focus their attention on the remaining kids.  The book's ending makes the meaning behind Anna's action pointless, she finally gains the freedom to choose just to fall back into being nothing more than parts. Her life ends with her becoming the only thing they intended her for. So personally i think the movie gave a more satisfying ending that felt right. Both sisters get to stand with their decision instead of their mother's. I would honestly love to hear others thoughts on this subject. Do you think the movie was wrong to change the result?"

        "body": "First off, nothing but spoilers ahead.   This is just a rant about Kingdom of Heaven, and how, over the years, I've strained so hard to like it. Even through the different versions and edits I have really tried to tell myself this is good film but what I always return to is the failure of the character Balian. (and Orlando. He did what he could with the script, but he's still a part of the problem in the end.) Kingdom of Heaven had infinite potential in its cast, a backdrop that was cinematic and epic with scenery, and a score that was sweeping. (minus the one musical cue stolen from The 13th Warrior which happens for no reason at the most pivotal moment in the film) -But it all came down like a house of cards because Balian is paper thin in personality and everything around him is gifted to him. Over the course of the film, Balian is; an expert blacksmith, a top tier swordsman, (despite what a 5 minute lesson might suggest) handed a knighthood as a Baron, given a ticket to the holy land on a boat which is destroyed at sea which only he survives, kills men who in theory should have been more skilled and experienced than he is, given an entire plot of land and people and loyal soldiers, thrown into the good graces of the king and his beautiful sister who both love him right away, given the command of an entire army and castle and even offered the damn throne. Now, I'm not saying this is what makes the character bad, but if you're going to give your protagonist absolutely everything, you need the balance of downs against those ups, and you need us to want to see him earn at least some of those ups. Balian not only doesn't earn those things, but he squanders them. I'll get to that in a second.  Next time you watch this film, play a little game where you listen to what Balian's friends and enemies say to him that are relevant and inspiring. Note how little Balian contributes to the dialogue and you see the second biggest problem; Everyone around this dude is cooler than he is. Observe as characters that are badass die-off while we're stuck instead with Balian, a man who sad-frowns his way through an epic that seems to push him forward like a toddler balancing on dad's shoes while he teaches him to walk. Why couldn't that German guy who fought with an arrow in his throat be the hero? We got like 2 seconds of him. Liam neeson was cool, he ran shit, but he's gone already. Imad ad-Din could have had his entire army come for Balian but instead he bows out of honor in losing a fight. Your quality will be known among your enemies, before ever you meet them, there's no comeback to that. Tiberius with his badass voice and no nonsense approach because he knows what's really going on. Sibylla is sultry and facing great emotional choices, Norton shines as a king without even showing his face, Saladin takes no shit, even Guy and Reynald hold the screen better. Then there's our hero. F*ckin' boring. Gifted everything. Nothing cool to do, nothing funny to say. Ohh does making everyone a knight make them a better fighter?! ..yes... Not badass at all. Doesn't even make sense.  Lastly, Balian is given a chance to save thousands of lives and kill one Guy, get the girl, and make a Kingdom of Heaven... but he doesn't do it because he has ..principles? and the movie ends in a confusing battle that doesn't even resolve and Balian ends up back where he started from. What a waste of time. Sure, it could be argued that this was the parallel of the crusades, but the message held no weight with this hero. Balian builds up his territory for his people and for what? To give it up when he had the chance to make a difference. The only good advice he gives in the entire film is to not chase Saladin into the desert, but this is already after he has given up the real chance to prevent it. Tiberius says there is no more Jerusalem speech and Balian just watches him leave and says one word, no. Still nothing worth saying so he fights a battle and goes on a film ending speech about how his men will fight to the death and he'll never surrender the city and concludes it by surrendering the city. I could go on and on but I'm tired of writing. I would love to hear if there's anyone out there with more opinions on this film. I'm not a professional critic. Am happy to read what you all thought of it."

Field also establishes (over and over again) that Lydia's perspective as a conductor is to sublimate herself and channel the intentions of the composer. Also dope. Also terrific.   Here's the sticky bit -- Mahler specifically asks for off-stage players in his other symphonies. #2 for example, has an entire off-stage band!  SO, is Lydia not as good at her job as she'd like us to believe? Is her philosophy of interpretation bullshit? I refuse to believe this was just 'overlooked'. But was it? Ack! Halp!"

        "body": "It has been said--and laughed at--before, but each year it becomes more true. Computers have enabled us to create almost any visual we want. We are limited by imagination and render time.  The problem, at least the way I see it, is that it's inherently unimpressive to take in.  It is not unimpressive *in principal.* Knowing the skill it took, the sheer number of people and the collective decades of work that went into it, those numbers impress. And the quality of their work impresses. But when you take those massively expensive, technologically groundbreaking visuals and make them into scenes in movies, they don't impress anymore. It becomes yet another kaleidoscopic color-scape that doesn't really mean much to me. When I want to see computer graphics pushed to their limits, I can get that in 3 minute doses on youtube. Mad Max's visuals are legendary, but if you remove them from the story context, they're arguably less interesting than Cyriak.  Why?  Story, of course. At this point you may be ready to bail because you're ready for this to turn into another they don't make 'em like they used to complain post. And I hope to prove you wrong. But yes, the answer is story--old or new, challenging or complex-- it's always story.  Story is the reason that we can be just as invested in Popsicle sticks and puppets as world-class CGI. People have cried (OK, *I* have cried) when Yoda dies in Return of the Jedi. And the quality of the workmanship by the Jim Henson creature shop impresses. And the puppetry by Frank Oz impresses. But if you put those same exact elements into a movie with a less comprehensible story (which may have happened, depending who you ask) then they no longer *impress* though they remain, factually, *impressive.*  So what am I supposed to think when people are telling me that I need to go see a movie for the visuals, when I'm already burnt out on the fireworks finale that is the average action scene? This, for me, is paradoxical. In a world where the limits on what a film can show have been obliterated, special effects *cannot* be the only thing that makes a movie worthwhile. It's like restaurants enticing customers by bragging about how indoor their plumbing is. It's a given at this point, and you only notice it when it goes wrong.  The most optimistic view is that people are so very invested in the story that it makes the visuals just that meaningful, and they mistakenly think that means the visuals are all that mattered. It's not uncommon for people to confuse story investment with being impressed by visuals.  But I'm not able to manage this optimism unfortunately, and I am forced to suspect that a movie which one must see for the visuals is one that I'm just not gonna get much out of. Because the visuals only matter if the story is good, and nobody is talking about the story."

I have never been a huge Disney fan, I'd rather watch a DreamWorks movie any time, but recently I've been checking new Disney movies to see what they've been feeding the new generation of kids. And I think it's fair to say, it's uninspired boring garbage.  The plots are extremelly predictable, the characters are one-dimensional and stereotypical, the dialogues are super cliché. Watching Strange Worlds in the theatre yesterday gave me a headache. The way these characters talked to each other reminded me of staged prank videos of 2010 youtube. The animation didn't look good, no matter how much money the spent on it, every character looked like another character from other animated movies. Lightyear also. It was the most boring, bland and sterilised movie I've ever watched. No remarkable struggle or conflict for a viewer to enjoy, only over-the-top cheesy emotional scenes with no value since we don't feel any connection to the shallow, poorly-written characters. Both these movies were supposed to be progressive and something we've never seen before but they managed to display more stereotypes and copy-paste character archetypes than any other dark disney movie of the past.   30 years ago, The Hunchback of Notre Damme managed to display both ethnic minority characters and a disabled person and humanise all of them, prove racism towards them is evil, make them all have a believable and inspiring arc and have a great story overall. What's more progressive than displaying gypsy and disabled characters as protagonists in a 90s movie? THAT was actually groundbreaking. I think the difference between Disney movies back then and the modern ones is that Disney used to animate already existing stories or at least existing concepts which all seem timeless and can be enjoyed by all ages at all eras. My parents used to love taking me to the theatre to watch animated movies with me because animated movies used to be family movies, not kids movies. I can't say the same for my future kids.   My suggestion for all animation studios that are still alive and still have a future (so many have closed down in the past 20 years...) is to give another chance to 2D animation and experiment with more mature plots. This polished, sterilised animation style has to go.  Maybe they should animate more classic stories and fairytales, with a modern twist of course to make them more relatable, and include more timeless and humanitarian concepts. Disney must understand that no amount of coloured or LGBT characters will make a boring movie interesting. No amount of dramatic action scenes can save a plot from being unattractive to wide audiences.  Thank you for coming to my TED talk. Would love to hear your opinions on."

I just watched it for the first time and already need to watch it again! So many questions! Is it all in his head? Did he really do the murders? Here are questions that I personally have kinda arguing why I personally think it might be mostly in his head:  If it was real, how come when he kills Paul, there's no blood anywhere besides him and the body? Could've been just director error, but the film was so well made otherwise, I don't see them skipping that detail..  If it was real, then how come no neighbors came out and called the police when the prostitute screamed and ran down the hall banging on doors? And, he was running naked and bloody with a chainsaw, and no one came out? He would've had to go back to the apartment and clean up and get dressed in order to go home, how come no one called the police?  If it's real, then the whole lawyer scene was just strange. Yeah, could've been him saying “hey man, shut up. Secret is safe with me.” But I draw back to the fact that earlier in the movie when he was talking to the detective (if he even existed) he said that Paul was gay and that it wouldn't surprise him if he was in London with a man or whatever. What if the lawyer was his lover? Why else would they both be in London?   If it's real, the landlord lady? That whole thing was weird too, like yeah maybe she covered the whole thing up, but she did kind of look frightened by seeing Patrick. Maybe she knew he would be the only one who knew about all of that? This one I'm still in the air about.   I could maybe see the homeless/random person killings being real, but I really don't know if all of them were. I think that a lot of them were him imagining them while listening to his walkman at work and drawing and kind of zoning out into a trance like state.

I'm going to first present my changes I'd make if I were one of the writers and then go over them after the bit. The goal is maximum satisfaction with minimal changes.  First and not part of the ending changes, ejection wings need to have been used or otherwise setup earlier in the movie. It could have just been a throw away line of dialogue when discussing the newest ships specs, that there wasn't a settup to that payoff was just sloppy writing.  Okay onto the main changes, we're keeping everything the same up until the fight on the bridge of Old Buzz/Zurg's ship (except for adding the wing settup).   Izzy and Sox see the fighting going on across the gulf of space, they start their jump and miss sooner into the action. The bump into the console that causes them to miss also destroys the console this is also where we get both Buzz and Old Buzz stunned. Under the bridge Izzy manages to grab hold but Sox does not and to save him she has to fully let go and leap into the void facing her greatest fear, but even though Sox is a robot she's not ready to let him go into the thing that scares her the most alone. But now she can't get back to the ship without help. So she radios Buzz.  Back on the bridge we get a perspective shot of one of the Buzz's opening their eyes when they hear a voice calling for Buzz to help, but what they see isn't Izzy it's Alisha her grandmother. They call out “I'm coming!” and that's when we realize it's old Buzz's voice. Old Buzz goes out the airlock in the Zurg suit and goes to rescue who he thinks Alisha but when he gets there the blurriness fades and he has a moment of anger/fear/not understanding “who are you? You're not Alsiha! “No, I'm Izzy Hawthorn her granddaughter, who are you? How do you know my Grandmother?” We get a shot of Old Buzz's face in the Zurg suit, a look of recollection crosses his face, flash back to him briefly seeing her after returning from one of his missions, of him seeing the hologram of her talking with her grandmother about him, he realizes the terrible things he's done and what he was about to undo, he brings her back to the ship.  Back on the bridge young Buzz greets them and then gets to tell Izzy how proud Alisha would have been of Izzy facing her fear and saving Sox. Old Buzz seeing this them collapses and the helmet mask thing comes off. Izzy is now faces with the realization that the man who was attacking them and doing those terrible things was also her grandmother's friend. Sox also is confronted with why there are two Buzz signals, and the remains of the old destroyed Sox. There's not too much time to ruminate on it though because the console being smashed means they can't stop the self destruct sequence or the rampaging robots. They're going to use the teleporter to get back to the ship but Old Buzz looks at the destroyed Sox guiltily not willing to go because of the guilty of what he's done. The current Sox puts his paw on him though and says “She wanted us to help you help yourself through your guilt”. And he goes with them.   They teleport and the ship still explodes before they have the fuel crystal loaded. Buzz gets the crystal and loads it into the ship but they still have too much inertia and some of the control surfaces were damaged so Buzz still does the thing with the wings to try and save the ship but it's not enough power. Old buzz goes out of the ship in his Zurg suit to help him, he takes the load and Buzz acts like a rudder or aileron. The rest of the team all still do their stuff but the landing's still rough and the Zurg suit is badly damaged. They get out to check on Old Buzz and it turns out his lower back was broken in the crash and he can't feel his legs.   The authorities arrive and Old Buzz agrees to do the time for the things he did/was going to do. He looks to young Buzz as he's being brought away, You know I did this all because I just wanted the chance to fly as a ranger again and now I never will. You'll have to fly enough for the both of us.   The crystal is used not to send everyone home, because now the population is too large on this planet to take the ship back. Instead they use it to send representatives to establish contact with the larger human civilization. Distant relatives of families that were separated when the science ship was first stranded are finally reunited. The misfit crew then get to become the Universal Protective Galactic Rangers or whatever. Young Buzz and crew get ready to launch back at mission control we see Burnsides watching as Old Buzz helps with the launch from control side with exosuit/robotic legs to help him walk and one of the wrist monitors Darby was wearing.  So, I think this fixes the issues that I found unsatisfying with the original ending. First the emotional catharsis didn't feel like it was there in the original ending, I think this brings more feelings to it. It addresses old Sox death, gives Izzy more of a moment confronting her fear, Old Buzz learns a karmic lesson and gets a chance to move on. Second, Disney is surprisingly blood thirsty when it comes to villains, without giving them the chance for redemption, and I think some examples of empathy/restorative justice are good examples to make. I don't think taking a life should be done as easily as it is in kids movies, even if they're a bad person. Third, this addresses an issue I had with them film that was really never addressed and that's what about the people where the Tulip came from? You know, their mission control, and their families, and the world they left behind. Yes, they started a new one on the new planet but still it's weird that they all just became okay with not letting Earth(?) know what happened to them. Finally, I know it's a kid's animated movie, but Buzz using the wingsuit to support and steady the ship broke my suspension of disbelief. I could more easily swallow it and suspend disbelief if the beefier Zurg suit was also pitching in to help. And I think that covers it."

I also like how they had more heart than expected and they covered all these different stages of life and how the whole series actually has the theme of growing up. I liked the characters and actually felt sad at the end of the last one. Anyway, American Reunion is one of the better legacy sequels I feel. The high school reunion setting is the perfect setting, the movie stays true to the characters in the original films, and finishes out all their arcs. The writers/directors are Jon Hurwitz/Hayden Schlossberg who went on to make Cobra Kai. The way they treat Johnny in that show is similar to how they do Stifler here. Taking the same character and transporting him to a new time and let him remain the same despite how the world around him as changed. Honestly, if you want to make any legacy sequel, hire these guys"

To know what I mean, watch the “Everything is new to me” part in the film where Pinocchio sings (scene where he is first introduced) in multiple different languages and just compare them to one another. It's a demanding song for a young voice actor and Pinocchio's voice sounds IDENTICAL across different languages.   Disney classics and Pixar films have also been amazing in casting very similar sounding voices across languages. How do they do this? How is it possible these voice actors sound like the _same person_ speaking different languages? Are these just genuinely similar-sounding people or are modern films using some kind of voice-changing technique to make sure all voice acting sounds true to its original actor's voice?"

Then later i think he (Daniel Brühl) got hit by a explosion which kinda messed one side of his face, and he fell in love with the nurse or they were already dating not sure. That's all I remember. After that i think there was a time skip and perhaps he turned into a villain of sort."

Even though we know in real life Hitler dies later on at his own hands, here Tarantino gives us the catharsis of watching him and the other Nazis get shot to death (and also burned alive) a bunch of times.   I've got this idea in my head of audiences watching the movie in 2009, filled with dread, because they know Hitler can't die yet so all our heroes are doomed to fail. It makes the fact that Hitler actually does die feel like such a cool, triumphant twist. But were audiences really as surprised by this as I like to think they were, or did they already sort of know going in to expect some historical revisionism? (I didn't watch it until years later.)"

But anyways, that's a topic for a different day. Today I wanted to discuss a different, though somewhat unexpected issue when at the theater with your friends. It's kind of hard to explain so let me try to explain it through a simple story.  So my friends and I are all talking and having a genuine good time as we are walking into the theater. We use the bathroom, buy our popcorn, etc. and then walk into our specific auditorium. As we walk up the stairs, we find the right row for us to sit in, walk down the aisle to our reserved seats. Whatever order we happen to be in is the same order we are in when we sit down in our seats. Now here's the thing: if you happen to be at the front or end of the group, then you likely got an edge seat, where instead of having two neighbors, you have one.  Now, I don't know about you guys, but this can sorta blow, especially if you are not as close with the guy you happen to sit next to. This definitely doesn't ruin a movie or anything like that, but it can really bug me out a lot more than I think it should and I was wondering what other people had to say about it. I don't want to be that guy who asks to switch seats. That just feels rude. Idk, there just doesn't really seem to be any good solution to it other than to position yourself smartly in advance haha.  Edit: so a lot of people have been telling me that this really shouldn't matter and that the fact I'm talking to my neighbors is pretty bad and I should just watch the movie. In hindsight, I totally get that and will keep it in mind going forward. But at the same time, is it really that bad to whisper to each other like a few times and share a few giggles that no1 else outside my friends will hear?"

He really imbues the character with pathos, and you can see the transformation take place over the course of the spirit visits. The supporting cast is fantastic as well, especially David Warner as Bob Cratchit. It's really hard to believe this was a made-for-TV movie--Scott treats it like a Shakespeare production of the highest order. A true classic."

        "body": "Aside from the movie itself as a whole, I'm curious to know what endings truly hit the emotional button for individuals here in the sub. (My eyes aren't tearing up I just have allergies)  I've been in love with movies since I was a kid and there are so many memorable cinematic experiences out there. Whether action packed, sci-fi, horror, dramatic or otherwise, movies can reach art form to me when they are relatable and I find some personal connection with them. So fellow movie buffs, what ends to which movies hit you the hardest? No wrong answers of course, this is all subjective!  My list is as follows in no particular order. (Spoilers)  **1.** *Braveheart*\\- FREEEEEEDOM!   **2.** *Gladiator*\\-  Father to a murdered son, Husband to a murdered wife, And I will have my vengeance... in this life or the next. Along with an astounding soundtrack what more can I say.   **3.** *The Sixth Sense*\\- The twist ending was out of this world when I first saw it in theaters but was also heart wrenching when Bruce Willis's character makes peace with his death as well as saying his farewells to his sleeping wife.   **4.** *Terminator 2*\\- Saw this for the first time at a hotel back in 93. Easily one of my all time favorite movie memories. More impactful than sad but nonetheless Arnie melting himself to the T2 theme. Whew   **5.** *No Time to Die-* Daniel Craig's Bond has mastered his way through nearly every situation he's been in but when he's inches away from peace with his family, his luck runs out. Couldn't Q at least make him a bubble suit? Sigh.   **6.** *Titanic*\\- Jack is a cool cat who sweeps a helpless Rose off her feet from the overly controlling and mundane existence with her rich fiance and mother. From Jack and Rose's fight for survival as well as the 2,240 other passengers as Titanic sinks, this movie tugs at the heart.   **7.** *Forrest Gump-* A masterpiece full of loss, joy, love, humor, and perseverance from a young man who seems slower than others but is probably sharper than a needle point.     Feel free add the same movies I've added if they've impacted you or different movies that hit you harder. I'd love to see some lists of movies I haven't thought of or perhaps haven't even seen.   ## "

Sonic was only redesigned because it was more than just fans who found the old look uncomfortable, and Jeff Fowler (or someone else I forgot who) was very well meaning about fans reactions and risked all the toy deals to make it more appealing.  It is very unlikely for any studio would undertake such a risky move. But what about the studios that did take that move? You know how a lot of early 2000s movies changed scenes because of 9/11 like spiderman or Lilo and Stitch.  Something like that, what are some movies where the audience reaction caused them to change entire characters, scenes or even actors?"

Man, what a terrific documentary though. Touching and heartfelt. They ended up with such a great relationship that is so genuine and unforced, but you could also see the pain that RDJ still deals with when they discussed his early years and the regret from Senior was palpable in those moments as well.  That said, I don't feel like this was ever an unhappy film, it was bursting with life and creativity and the love of those things.  Thanks to the both of them for giving us a great film.

Portrayed as a gruff man of incredible power presiding over the largest battle in human history, a man who casually orders the suicide of battle-hardened high ranking generals when he sees fit.   However, when he picks up the phone and hears the voice of his boss, Joseph Stalin, he goes white as a sheet.  From television, but another example would the scene in Boardwalk Empire where Nucky Thompson meets with billionaire and treasury secretary Andrew Mellon.  Nucky, the main character, is not only a ruthless gangster but a wealthy legitimate businessman and a powerful political figure with all sorts of friends in high places and fingers in pies, the epitome of corruption and influence.   But when he goes to see possibly the most powerful financial figure in the country in a Diogenes club style retreat that looks like the kind of smoke-filled-room the Illuminati would hold meetings in, he looks as nervous and powerless as a little kid.

I got low expectations since I didn't watch the first movie and was disappointed with Shrek 4.. And boy, I was pleasantly surprised in the quality of the movie and was excited to the future ot Shrek's franchise!  As a huge fan of Spiderverse, I was so excited that it's style of animation was being felt in the movie. It's like the best blend of 3D animation and 2D drawings. There are scenes in the movie in which my eyes nearly pops out on the smoothness and stylistic choices of the animation (there isa scene that it looks like came from a comic book).. It should be seen to believed and I think it's the most accomplished animated film this year technically..  The story is simple but it asks difficult questions about mortality, the sense of being a family and someone's wish and version of happiness. I think IGN is right when they say it's like a Logan film.. The answers it asks may be difficult, but in the end it successfully wraps it up with a sense of accomplishment.. Kudos to the arc of the Goldilocks and Bears, it got me manly tears and Florence Pugh is really a star!  The highlight of the show is Perrito, the therapy dog. The film got so much laughs for his antics but underlying that is a sad story of a dog wishing for a family.. The themes of family is very pervasive of  and I'm so thankful that they handled it beautifully.   The voice cast is phenomenal. Antonio Banderas is Puss in Boots and his character arc with Kitty Softpaws is probably the best part of the film. Goldilocks and the Bear family is impressive and Samson Kayo as a baby bear is a standout! Salma Hayek gives her Kitty Softpaws character a sense of vulnerability and longingness that will delight you. The less said about Wagner Moura's The Wolf the better, you should hear him in screen to be really AFRAID..   Last but not the least, the humor is amazing. There are some references that will get heavy laughs tinged with sadness (Perrito, I love you!) .. The balance of humor with popular culture is top-notch.   Overall, this is one of my favorite films of the year and is leagues above the Disney/Pixar 2022 output. I really wish that it would win an Oscar since HTTYD didn't win any.. DreamWorks is in the roll and I'm excited for their future succes! I can't say enough good things about the movie!   5/5  Technically marvelous with outstanding voice cast, Puss in Boots asks difficult questions and answers them beautifully"

They can portray Lucifer as a kind of Loki character, where he tricks and deceives other angels to join his side. He manipulates them by saying how arrogant and narcissistic the Christ god is. And the angels would be like “yea, you know what? You're right, this is bullshit!”  Then at the end there is a massive battle between all the arch angels leading as generals of their legion of angels vs Lucifer and his army. At the end of the battle, Lucifer loses and god punishes him by sending him into the fire realm.   Then you see Lucifer and his army fall into Hell and you see them lose their angelic look and become more monstrous and demonic. But the Christ gods plan backfires because instead of being punished, you see Lucifer become the ruler of Hell, and at the end of the movie you see the newly named Satan plotting in hell for his next attack, with his legions or monstrous demons bowing to him.  I'm not even a Christian and I think that shit would be pretty tight…"

        "body": "I just finished watching this movie and it really stayed with me however all the reading I've done online afterwards, no one has presented this explanation of the ending so I thought I'd make my case.  *SPOILERS*  I believe Paul sexually assaulted Frankie on one of the nights at the hotel. The night that Paul is stroking Frankie's hair and they're discussing whether she'll stay in Scotland her whole life. After they cut away from that, it cuts to the song Tender by Blur and adult Frankie is in the club watching her dad dance with the lights cutting in and out. I believe every time this scene comes up, it's adult Frankie having a PTSD flashback. In addition, the use of songs and song lyrics are so crucial in this movie which doesn't have much music otherwise. And the most telling thing for me was the way the scene ends, ominously zooming out on their hotel door. Something is clearly happening inside.   Lyrics to Tender by Blur  Tender is the night lying by your side Tender is the touch of someone that you love too much Tender is my heart, you know I'm screwing up my life Oh Lord, I need to find someone who can heal my mind  The next day Paul is hanging out on the ledge of the balcony and looks like he's thinking about jumping. Later on, Frankie is sitting by the pool and she initially doesn't want her dad to put the sunscreen on her back (doesn't want to be touched by him). Which is out of character for her. I believe she's likely tucked away the memory of the previous night but feels a subconscious response that she doesn't want to be touched by him.  Later on that night, Frankie sings REMs Losing My Religion. Which I think is very telling of how she's feeling at that time, that was just a dream. It explains why Frankie was so upset at her dad afterwards, because she just wants to remember things as they were before, but him not agreeing to sing with her is a stark realization that things are now divided. It was not a dream.   At the end of the movie, Paul and Frankie have one final dance to Queen's Under Pressure. I believe this event triggers Frankie's memory of the terrible event that happened a couple nights prior. You can tell she doesn't want to dance but her father forces her. And at one point, you can see Frankie crying in her father's arms, almost struggling to get away. As a result, adult Frankie is now dealing with PTSD and the club dance scenes are how she's compartmentalized that memory. In addition, the Queen song's lyrics This is our last dance, This is ourselves, Under pressure explain a motive as to why everything has happened.   It's clear Paul is struggling with depression and where he is at currently in life. He feels pressure to be someone who's made something of himself at 30. I believe the purchase of the Turkish rug was an example of how flawed his thinking is, thinking that this rug will change his life or improve his relationship with his daughter. I don't believe we ever see the rug again. I think Paul latches onto the only person in his life who gives him unconditional and undivided attention. As a result, he makes the terrible mistake of confusing the love he has for his daughter as romantic love. And of course, their relationship never recovers.  All this seemed very obvious to me after I finished watching however most other explanations I've seen never mention any abuse and focus more on whether Paul killed himself at the end. I really think that point is almost irrelevant to the underlying theme of the movie, a child struggling to deal with a jarring event that happened in her past as an adult.   Let me know what you all think! At the very least it was cathartic to write out my thoughts on this movie, even if no one else agrees.  Thanks!"

Although these countries produce wide variety of content I think we should also see a other countries' approach in movie making. The success of parasite in Oscar's makes me think maybe more people will appreciate non english films. Maybe it's just me but I wanna experience other cultures on the big screen  With that said what countries do you think will be more popular or should be more recognize in cinema?  1. I think indian films are cool. I've only seen some amir Khan's  films so I'm not entirely sure. Not a big fan of the singing  parts but its tolerable and as I was surfing youtube last night, I'm surprise to  know that indian music have inspired some american songs. I think indian films getting more popular will not only promote their culture and philosophies but also promote exchange of ideas in music as well.  2. South east Asian films. I'll mostly talk about philippines but I assume other sea countries are the same like us culturally. Philippines have heavy folklore, we have lots of gory monsters and spirits, I believe other south east Asian countries are too. Westerns movies are usually about personal growth while Japan's are about friendships and teamwork, we are just like japan but I think on a bit bigger scale. Were all about collectivism, it's like the whole community is one whole family. Right now our cinemas is mostly bad or a copycat of other cinemas but i  think it'll get better if we embrace our culture more. I hope to see more of our values, philosophies and folklore on our cinemas in the future.  3. Chinese movies. We all know how fun chinese action and kung fu movies can be. Comedies are great too not just the kungfu comedy but film like cj7 is also great. Honestly, I dont know a lot about Chinese films, I love Jackie chan and I've seen some of stephen chow's hits, but that's that. I wanna see more of these films. Maybe its just nostalgia because these films are fun to watch as a kid but really I wish seeing this movies and I wanna see more of them.  These are some of my ideas what else do u think?"

However, rather than shitting on the movie, I want to see if anyone can answer some of these questions that leave me so frustrated.  - Why were all the cooks so obsessed with the main Chef? Why did they simply accept the idea of dying? It is told to us that he wasn't even the one who suggested the idea of everyone dying, it was simply another cook. I know the movie hints to the idea of it being a cult of some sort... But why? How? What's the context?  - Why does the Main Chef obsess with the protagonist girl 'Margot' beyond the fact she's also someone working in the service industry (as a prostitute). Why does he purposefully lie about them needing a barrel to make her fetch it? Why does his Right Hand of sorts shout You will not replace me!!! To Margot when she's trying to kill her? Wasn't she aware that they would all die in the end anyway? What does she mean with replace really? What was the purpose of creating such chaos in the first place for the main chef??  - Why is there an exact replica of the restaurant inside of the Chef's supposed Home where no one is allowed to enter? I assume that he was somehow planning it beforehand, but like... Huh? Does this mean everyone rehearsed it? In there? Why is it such a big reveal? Margot reacts in a way that expresses her surprise pretty openly to get the viewer's attention. The grey door seems to lead into a sort of special bedroom where it's hinted he even has (or had) a family. What's inside of the exact same door back in the main restaurant? It's clearly a big deal since Margot was told not to touch it when she was trying to find the bathroom.   - Why does everyone simply accept their murder? The clients, I mean. The Chef even remarks in an earlier scene that they could've easily escaped or somehow overcome their captors. But the peak of ridiculousness is them simply sitting down in place as they are dressed with chocolate and marshmallows just to watch the Chef walk in slowly and essentially murder them all.   - Was there anything deeper to Margot's date/client? Or was he literally just an insane individual? It is told to us that he was, for some reason, so accepting of his death that he went in knowing he'd die, just wanting to experience it all, even going as far as telling his girlfriend who breaks up with him. Could he really just commit suicide based on what the chef whispered? No matter how mean it was? And why *exactly* and how did he manage to have some personal contact with the main chef? He seems like a very deranged individual whose life revolves entirely around the restaurant.  - Margot was fearing for her life DEEPLY. And she found had empathy for the other clients, to the point where she openly tells them SHE called the coast guard to help them all escape. So why does she stop the boat and eat her burger like it's no big deal as she watches everyone burn to death? INCLUDING the innocent clients whose 'crimes' included going to a private college with no debt and acting in a bad movie. Is the answer really just Cause it's a dark comedy ????  These are some of the questions I can remember off the top of my head. I know this is supposed to also be a 'dark comedy' but I don't think it's an excuse for these things to be presented and have absolutely no explanation. The world SEEMS to be rooted in reality, so why do the characters behave so nonsensically??"

I love horror and action movies, but it feels very off when the successor is suddenly changing their genre. You know what I mean?  Spiderman 1 Villain looked maybe a bit silly, but tbh he was very terryifing in the way how he acted and while the action didnt look as spectacular with all the special effects as in the second one it was much more grounded, brutal and punchy.

They have no room for artistic movement and everything just looks too Disney/fake. The decisions they went with Willow is baffling as they're trying to modernize a fantasy. That's crazy. Star wars had no planning and the TV series have been up/down. Andor does differ a bit thank god.   Secondly it doesn't seem to ever think, let's do something new. Write a new IP from scratch, introduce a new hero. Next year I'm sure they'll do it again and ruin Indiana Jones."

Henry wants to give his kingdom to his son John for Christmas. Eleanor wants to give the same kingdom to their son Richard. Hilarity ensues as they try and bargain with each other to get what they want.  Discovering the importance of family: Check. Henry has some Christmas drama with his sons (including sentencing them to be executed) but ultimately realizes that family is the most important thing, and is unable to keep them imprisoned in the wine cellar.  A Christmas wedding: almost Check. Henry II arranges for Richard (his son) to marry Alais (his lover), despite her being betrothed to John (his other son). It all gets cancelled at the last second, however, when Richard discovers Henry is only doing it to get the Aquitaine.   Seasonal good cheer: In spades. How can you not feel good with a film that has such heartfelt dialogue as:  Eleanor: *My what a greedy little trinity you are: King, king, king! Two of you meet learn to live with disappointment*.  Henry: *Ah, but which two?*  Eleanor: *Let's deny them all and live forever.*  Henry: *Tusk to tusk through all eternity!*  Die Hard hasn't got anything on this film. It's comedic, eminently quotable, and has some career best performances from O'Toole and Hepburn."

However Mamma Mia: Here We Go Again is, while not a great movie, an improvement; there's still not much plot but at least the dual plots with Sophie and the younger version of Meryl Streep's character makes things more interesting as does its emotional core, the singing and choreography are much better, the editing is much smoother, and there's more color in that movie than orange."

This was the turn of the century. Live action/CGI movies seemed all the rage, but most were poorly done or poorly written. Stuart Little was different. When it came out in 1999, it was well written, well acted, and the animation was stellar. I dare say it is a classic today.  Come 2002, when Stuart Little 2 came out. Everyone from the first film came back. I'd argue the second film is better than the first. By that time, Pixar had released two Toy Storys and A Bug's Life, but the animation in Stuart Little 2 still manages to stand up today. It's just a fun movie, with jokes for kids and adults. Plenty of jokes I remember from the sequel but didn't get until I had the internet to explain them to me; a hallmark of early 00's kids movies/TV that practically begged parents to watch the shows with their kids. Parents were also much more likely to watch shows with their children back then, instead of just turning on the TV and forgetting about it, so movies and shows had to contain a blend of humor fitted to kids and adults.   Stuart Little and it's sequel contain plenty of those “adult” jokes. The humor is clever, but tame for kids. The animation is immersive and hasn't aged a day. The performances are surprisingly good (who would've thought Dr. House would make such a good WASP).   It's an iconic part of my childhood, and I'm glad to enjoy it still, even as the years have passed me by. If I don't like watching Stuart Little and it's sequel when I'm 50, then I hope I die at 49."

This is bound to be a really divisive film and it will no doubt be talked about in years to come. The marketing was brilliant in how it didn't reveal much. I think the movie could defy expectations and be a legit Box Office hit like Black Swan.  The movie is overwrought and melodramatic but there's never been anything like it, at least that I've seen, in the cinema. And, like Requiem, I never want to watch it again. Fraser was amazing.

However, while I found the 2017 It adaptation to be a fantastic film, the necessary second part fell short after 45 minutes.  The second It movie, depicting the latter half of the novel, was masterfully done. The tension I felt in that first third of the movie (Chapter Two was a long film) is unparalleled. The perfect transition between the characters having suppressed their time in Derry and the full realization was masterful. It also established the secondary ability of Pennywise to befuddle the memories of adults who leave Derry perfectly.   That said, the film that had grabbed my attention raptly in the first 45 minutes slowly waned in the middle act of flashbacks, and lost my attention fully in the final third act. It felt like the ending of the first film in redux, but with more emotional weight attached.  I will admit that I haven't read the original novel, and I fully intend to when budget permits. I have no doubt that every effort possible was made to make a faithful adaption of the novel in the making of these films. I might as well be criticizing the latter half of the novel at the same time I'm criticizing the second film.   Having only seen the 2017 film and its 2019 sequel, I have to view it in that context. I loved the 2017 film, but the sequel is a compelling follow up that doesn't quite stick the landing. From what I understand, this isn't a major departure from most of Stephen King's books, so I guess my review is pretty generic in that regard."

You could even do this in a mad lib style:  In [NOTABLE HISTORIC PERIOD], our protagonist played by [FAMOUS ACTOR] who's undergone [DISTURBING PHYSICAL CHANGE] is challenged by [TERRIBLE MENTAL ILLNESS] and [UNPLEASANT DISABILITY], dealing with [VERY SERIOUS SUBJECT].

It's a comedy about two down-on-their-luck cops trying to investigate a crime nobody believes has been committed. It's utterly ridiculous, with moments of low-brow comedy that verges on parody.   But the movie is also about how a big time investor has lost dozens of billions of dollars from a major corporation, is about to defraud the US government to pay back his losses, and nobody wants to do anything about it, to the point where they have to hand over the case to the head of the financial crimes bureau who also happens to be the investor's lawyer. With no other options, the protagonists have to go rogue.   It's a movie that insists on showing us that the big corporation which had people murdered and attempted to steal 32 billion from the Police pension fund just got a government bailout at the end of the movie, being too big to fail.   It's a movie that has a credit sequence dedicated to showing the audience what a Ponzi scheme is, and how absurd was the AIG government bailout.  Then, 5 years later, Adam McKay drops The Big Short, about how the utter corruption within the financial industry, and how collusion between government and private agencies led to the 2008 crash and the subsequent government bailouts. He's hitting the same theme on the head that he tried to do with the other guys, only this time in a serious mold.  I just find it hilarious how he had this idea, tried to say it in a comedy (ended up making one of the best comedies of the decade) then expanded that idea on a serious high-brow oscar contender starring Christian Bale and a boatload of other serious people.  What I'm trying to say with this, is don't go chasing waterfalls."

On the other hand there's nothing all that new narratively, Sid isn't funny despite Leguizamo giving it his all, honestly the movie in general is more mildly chuckleworthy than hilarious, and the other saber tooth villains are kind of dull and underwritten.  Also yes that baby isn't cute despite how the movie keeps insisting he is nor has the animation really held up (Some shots look fine while others look nearly Foodfight-esque).  But yeah it's not bad or horrible just nothing that special which is probably why this franchise, despite how many of them there are and how much money they made, never really got the cultural impact that Shrek or any of the Pixar movies or Frozen or Despicable Me or Encanto got, at least as far as the United States is concerned.

Now that it's on Netflix I really want to rewatch it high and see what's up. * **Bodies Bodies Bodies -** When I saw Pete Davidson was in this I thought it was going to be a very different movie and didn't expect it to be anywhere near as fun as it actually was. * **The Lost City -** The movie was exactly what the trailers said it would be. It was fun, it was silly, and it was cheesy. But sometimes we need that - All of us. * **The Unbearable Weight of Massive Talent** * **Bros** \\- I know this one didn't get a lot of good buzz but I really enjoyed it. At times it felt like the cinematography was a bit off, and it felt more like little vignettes more than a feature length movie, but overall it was fun. * **The Black Phone -** This hits a lot of the same notes as The Menu and X. * **Pearl** \\- A nice followup to X, and I loved the Wizard of Oz vibes, but I don't think it stands up at the same level. * **Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness -** As someone who grew up on Sam Raimi horror at an age way earlier than I probably should have been shown Army of Darkness, I think this resonated with me a lot more than it did with other people.  # Enjoyed far More Than I Expected  * **Elvis** \\- I've been thoroughly enjoying most of the biopics coming out of Hollywood lately, but I have no connecting to Elvis and mostly only went because my wife wanted to go. Ended up feeling like it was a little long, but wasn't at all mad about it. * **Dog** \\- I went in expecting a mostly generic movie, but walked out really liking the message. * **Sonic The Hedgehog 2**  \\- I think the first one was better, but I still enjoyed it. * **Fall** \\- As someone who hates heights more than anything, I spent the entire movie cringing in my seat. I'm sure it's not the greatest movie in the world, and I've definitely seen those twists happen before, but if a movie can make me feel the way this felt, I can't exactly call it bad. * **Scream -** There were certainly parts where I was rolling my eyes, like the point where horror movies always seem to have that the bad guy is down, and we should kill him, but lets talk instead, and now one of us is going to die, but I mostly think they did a good job with the update. * **Amsterdam -** The movie was long and it felt long, but I think it was a hell of a lot better than I expected it to be.  # Enjoyed it, but Probably Wouldn't Watch Again  * **Everything Everywhere All at Once -** It was fun. It was silly, but I don't think it was as incredibly as everybody else seems to think it is. If it's any consolation, my wife was in love. * **Ticket to Paradise** \\- Hit a lot of the same notes as The Lost City, but it felt like it ended on the wrong note and could have shaved a good 15 minutes from the runtime and been a better movie. * **Nope** \\- People love this one. My wife loves this one. I don't hate this one, I just have no interest in seeing it again. * **Thor: Love and Thunder -** It's the funny and silly Thor we've come to expect ever since Ragnarok, and I know some people are over it, but I enjoyed it. Though the movie was long and I wouldn't want to sit through it again. * **The Batman** \\- To me, the movie felt longer than it should have been and that it tried to do too much with its run time. I remember sitting in the theater and thinking, This is a natural stopping point, but than having to spend another hour watching more. I think I would have enjoyed this far better if The Batman was split into a 2 part movie to be fleshed out further. * **The Bob's Burgers Movie** \\- Anytime animated shows get pushed to the big screen I feel like the formula that makes them work feels off, and I don't think this was any different for me. * **Minions: The Rise of Gru** \\- It was cute, and I laughed. Though there was definitely a 15 minute portion in the middle I fell asleep during. * **The Northman** \\- It was a good movie, but a long movie. I didn't realize it was directed by Robert Eggers until I mentioned to my wife afterwards that it felt a hell of a lot like The Lighthouse - - -And then there was a fake mall shooting and we ran for our lives, so my recollection of the movie is. . .Tainted?  # The Mediocre Movie I Expected it to be  * **Uncharted -** I love the games, and this felt like a generic National Treasure sequel, but it's also pretty much exactly what I went into the movie expecting. * **Black Panther: Wakanda Forever -** I fully enjoyed the tribute to Chadwick Boseman, but the overall movie felt too long, and the storylines felt like they clashed more than they built off of each other. * **Black Adam -** I've become a little disillusioned with most DC movies so I didn't expect too much. So maybe it was slightly above my expectation. * **Where the Crawdads Sing -** Really loved the book, and while I enjoyed the film, I don't think it necessarily did the book justice at all. The movie had a firm beginning and end, but it didn't do enough to setup any of the important relationships to make any of the story really feel strong. * **Don't Worry Darling -** I think this tried to hit a lot of the same notes as Men, but did it a lot better, though, I still thought the whole thing was long and convoluted. * **Beast -** Didn't hate it. Didn't love it. My time wasn't wasted, but my mind also wasn't blown. * **Halloween Ends -** I really enjoyed the first movie in the new trilogy, hated the second one, and this one felt somewhere between the two. * **Fantastic Beasts: The Secrets of Dumbledore -** Similar to Halloween this one felt like it fell between its two predecessors. I feel like the whole franchise had a Dumbledore problem that could have been solved with him having his own movie, but it was still a step up from the travesty of the second movie.  # Expected More and Left Disappointed  * **Violent Night** \\- I was hoping to get something more like Krampus. I never expected the movie to be amazing, or have a real message, but I did expect to be laughing in silly ways.  * **Jurassic World Dominion -** It was bad, that is all. * **Studio 666** \\-Again, I never expected this movie to be good, but I did expected it to be at least fun. And I didn't find it to be anything more than forgettable.  # Worst of the Year  * **Men -** I felt like this movie had a lot it wanted to try to say, and that there was a lot of heart behind trying to make a point, but that it just didn't succeed on any of those points. I left the theater with my wife imagining a Goose at the end of the tunnel making the signature tones. . And that thought alone was better than the whole movie. * **The Invitation** \\- I left the theater feeling like a dozen recent movies did what The Invitation tried to do, but better. It was basically Read or Not, but nowhere near as good.  # Hoping to See by the End of the Year  * Devotion * The Whale * Avatar * Babylon * I wanna Dance * A Man Called Otto"

I'm a big Aubrey Plaza fan and this is some of her best work I think. It's probably her juiciest and most complex dramatic role, and she does still get to use a bit of her trademark sarcasm that's so amusing. And all of the supporting performances are solid too. Theo Rossi in particular is good at being mysterious yet still likable.  The story and how it's presented reminded me of Uncut Gems, which I thoroughly enjoyed, but I liked the more low-key approach this took. The tension is still palpable but it's not nearly as loud and stress inducing. It makes everything seem so easy and matter of fact, making it easier to understand why Emily does what she does. In a way, I think this is a bit more realistic than Uncut Gems.  It's technically proficient as well. It's edited into a tight 90 minute package, and that combined with the cinematography find creative ways to capture the more frenetic moments. I hesitate to call them action sequences, but they kind of are, and regardless, this clearly had a pretty low budget, and doing those scenes couldn't have been easy.  I would've liked to see this in theaters, actually. I really dug it, and I'm glad to see it so high on the Netflix charts already."

So I was quite pleasantly surprised with how good it was when I finally saw it.   Barbarian meanwhile, has a deliberately vague trailer that didn't give its plot away. I won't spoil anything but wow. I did **not** expect the movie to turn out the way it did. Twists and turns at every second. Just a fun, unpredictable wild ride at the cinemas.   If you're planning on doing a horror double feature, definitely try watching these two back to back. It's truly one hell of an experience."

So in the beginning of the weirdness, there was at least one attempt at a cover up that I remember, which was the first bacon breakfast. When he goes back and sees the place cleaned up, what was the point if ultimately the alts we're going to reveal themselves. Off the bat, I'm convinced the wife that went back with the real hubby was the Alt wife. Now as far as these alts, if they're real and this isn't some trippy hallucinations from the weed, how are they produced to look so much like the originals. I mean, they weren't just twins they were clones. So is this magic. The force shield definitely shows what we're seeing is real and not some imagination. Also, why have the patient files on the property; it was meant to be discovered. Mostly I was disappointed by the reveal of the alts; if they kept the psychological thriller aspect going the movie would have had a deeper meaning, instead we're just dealing with magical realism and things are too conveniently explained away."

Heard it was adopted from a short story so perhaps there were some heavy edits by the screenwriters.  **Stuff I cheered at:**  * Finally seeing an alternative Black girl giving that goth/emo/punk feel as the lead in a movie. There are so many girls like that but we still don't see them on screen.    * Also, she does cheerleading! We don't have to stick to stereotypical tropes. * Cool to have a movie centered around a relationship with two girls where romance isn't at the center of the drama. Conflict can be created over the most mundante things. * Better stories about grief and dying. It's not always sadness. There's a mix of emotions and we'll all experience it at some point. * Showing a healthy father/daughter relationship. Awesome to see a dad check in on their child, make dinner and be aware of stuff happening/people in her life.  **Stuff that made me scratch my head:**  * Why are we trying to develop friendship between an *obvious bully and outcast*? At the beginning, it is clear that Capri (the queen bee) goes out of her way to tease/torment Darby: >!calling her 'freak show', embarrasing her in class, stealing her clothes after Darby's showered.!<    * >!Nevermind, that they used to be friends and had mutual respect for their athletic abilities. Nevermind that she knows Darby's mother died when she was a kid. Nevermind that Darby isolates herself to protect herself from more bullying.!<    * >!Capri demands that Darby do what she wants and when Darby refuses, she plunges her head in a toilet. !<She keeps sabotages Darby until she gives in throughout the movie, never apologizing for the hell she put Darby through. * Why is she a free-of-charge social worker helping dead people move-on? >!She started doing this as a 6-year old and her father was okay with this? She never gets tired of this job though she never wants to talk about her own mom dying?!< * If we're going to have an 'alternative girl' character, can we do more than just show that she likes the color black? We hear some alternative rock in the movie but you don't see why she's interested in this culture. Just seeing dead people doesn't justify wearing black nearly all the time and then suddenly being okay with pastels after a makeover. * Unneeded romantic plot. >!Yes, Capri lost her boyfriend but why add a weird romance between him and Darby? Did she even like this guy? Their interaction was basically Darby giving free grief counseling. !<The plot by itself was interesting. * Obvious teen movie cliches: climbing social status in less than a month (the mean girls are suddenly letting her in the clique after hating her for several years), a nerdy boy having a glow up after middle school and becoming the 'hot boyfriend', ditzy/vain girls, immature/stupid boys,..."

For a little context, RRR is a tollywood movie, which means that it's original language is Telugu which is spoken in a couple of states in the south of the country. Unlike what most of the world believes, all Indian movies are not Bollywood; that refers only to hindi language movies, and there are many languages in India.   It's hard to describe what this movie is about because it bends genres like there's no tomorrow. Its plot briefly is this - RRR is about two men living in colonial India. They work for opposite sides and are fated to be pitted against each other, but without knowing each other's true identity, they become the best of friends. This movie has elements of everything. It is an action, drama, rom com, musical and buddy comedy movie wrapped in one and it. is. amazing!!!  The director, SS Rajamouli has really created a masterpiece. Everything is perfection. The character and world building is done so perfectly that what usually would be ridiculous and cringey is completely believable and fun here. The characters are nuanced and insanely well acted. The directing, musical score and dancing are out of this world, and the rewatchablity value is high.   Yes, it may require a certain amount of suspension of disbelief and a big chunk of your day (3 hours) to get through, BUT if you can get past that and be accepting of a few cultural differences in movie making, I assure you, it is going to be a VERY rewarding experience. It's in my top 3 movies this year and maybe of all time just for the sheer enjoyable nature of the film. Go check it out!  EDIT: Here to boost my Watch RRR campaign (LOL) by adding that they have just been nominated for a golden globe in the best non English language film and best original song. Love that for Indian cinema!"

I'm 34 and now have a 4&6 year old and I just rewatched today for the first time since they were born and I have a new appreciation for the ending.  I know im probably not the first to make a post like this...  I know the ending is a contentious issue with some people, is he asleep, is he dreaming, we never see the top topple at any point and it's left ambiguous as to whether or not he is asleep. The main point that many sleepers point to is that the kids haven't grown and are wearing the same clothes. The awake crew focuses on the top bobbling, and that he finally sees their faces.  As someone watching this with a different perspective on life now that I have kids, I still believe that this is relaity at the ending, however I now fully understand those who state that no matter what, reality or the dream, Cobb doesn't care because he's with his children. And this struck a huge emotional cord with me that it didn't before, and I completely understand him not caring if the top fell over and running to his kids because at the end, thats all he wanted and all he fought for the entire film.   My best friends son died in his sleep last year at 11 months old, and I know the personal hell he and his wife went through and Contiue to go through .  If I could chose a world where I was with my kids over another one, real or not, I'd chose that one 100% of the time.

I had a few misplaced preconceptions about the film that I now see came from people talking about The Road Warrior.  This is the world I was expecting when I saw Mad Max.  Wanton death and destruction in a desert wasteland, complete with culty marauders with a masked muscle-bound leather daddy leading them, a feral child, and DIY hotrods in a car chase fight.  I can barely imagine what happened between Mad Max and this that would change everything so much, but I really enjoy the speculation.  You can definitely see that Miller had a lot more money to make this film.  For what it is Mad Max is an excellent film with one of my now favorite villan performances and one of the best car jumps through another vehicle scenes every put to film.  The Road Warrior however, in my opinion, is the superior film simply because the story moves so much more quickly and precisely, and the world itself is built in a way that you can almost feel the desperation of its inhabitants.  It is by no means perfect and there is one part in the film that I could honestly do without, but I chalk that up to my personal sensibilities.  What are your honest thoughts on The Road Warrior?"

Then they get into this dance/ musical number and at the end of the song, the kids smile. Because of this, they get put into a cage. Another specific thing I remember was their “jail food” was served in this big wooden bowl and a wooden spoon.

The animation is fun and immersive. The music is also pretty good (i really liked the spanish harmonies with the electric guitar).  Thing is, this movie can be really dark and mature if it wants to be, and can hit you in the face with it's tense scenes. The way it handles Puss In Boot's relation to death is surprisingly dark and realistic and will definitely get children frightened. Two of my favourite scenes are the ones that touch on this side of the movie. One being the intorduction of wolfy boy which was shivering, and the other being a scene where PIB straight up has a panic attack. These scenes in themself are worth a watch in my opinion.  The unfortunate part is that the movie has an awful sense of humor like 85% of the time, and besides those scenes i mentioned above, it constantly drops jokes like every 5th sentence. And it's not just the comic relief character that does it...Literally everyone except wolfy boy. Wolfy boy has zero jokes in this movie, which gives the whole experience a bipolar up and down feeling with him being on the screen (which are the best parts of the movie tbh) and off. It wouldn't frustrate me this much usually, but DAMN...This movie could have been on another level and just way more coherent if it had just tuned it's humorous tone down and tried to come up with better jokes. Some of them kinda hit tho, but not many for sure. This also doesn't help with getting to like the main trio, but luckily some scenes got me attached to them by the end.  The movie left me liking it in general. I would even go as far as saying that this is the best animated movie of the year (even though we didn't have too many good ones).

But despite my stance of being problematic isn't the end of the world I find myself taken aback by things in older favorites I never noticed before.   The new Indy 5 trailer got me excited to watch the originals again. They've always been favorites but I realized I hadn't sat down to watch them through in some time.   Suffice it to say I was floored to see straight up yellow face in Raiders. A white stunt man with prosthetics made up to look Asian. I've seen Raiders dozens of times yet somehow never noticed until now.   It threw me for a loop, to be honest. There is also brown face in the film.   I will always consider Raiders one of my favorite films ever. Temple of Doom, which is more controversial, is my favorite Indy film period.   But I won't lie that these poorly aged elements aren't something of a sore spot to grudgingly get past.   I want to make it clear that I'm not talking about canceling anything nor am do I want this to devolve into a screed about political correctness and anti-wokeness.

I told my roommate who was choosing with me, She told me to read the bio and immediately i thought i wouldnt want to watch that. A man finds out his wife has been fantasising with another man and sets out in an orgasmic journey... - something like that.   But alright. Let's watch.  The start was definitely in line with what i expected. Straight out with nudity and superficial talk, jealousy, the potential man of the wife's fantasies...  What i didnt expect was how captivated i was by such slow scenes. The plot is outlandish but believable at the same time, the characters act normally (for the most part), the dialogue, the performances are incredible! The interactions, the looks, the back and forth. I thought this part was great.   However, the true masterpiece is in the entire setting.   The combination of the lighting, the MUSIC, with the things i just mentioned meshed together to create one of the best movie experiences i've ever had.   The piano made me Cringe every time it played.   They didnt give out too much information to maintain the suspense which is also in line with the vibe of the film, the secrecy of the organization and such.   I was constantly under the impression that this did not give me a fincher vibe... If i had to Guess, given i hadnt seen anything like that before, id say it was Kubrick from what i had heard about him, but i was pretty sure i had seen fincher at the start... Alas, i didnt, i mustve misclicked and mistakenly, and thankfully, introduced myself to Stanley Kubrick's work.    What a masterpiece"

Also, I've noticed on Reddit in general if something goes against popular consensus to any degree, people don't respond with thoughtful feedback but just downvote or even try to get a post banned.  Re-watched Get Out for the first time since its release and recognized its strengths more easily this second go-around. I remembered very little other than the main plot points and general themes.  The concepts of slavery and white envy of black physicality were innovative and thoughtful, if perhaps too obvious thematically and not particularly deep. Get Out also approached the perspective of how woke liberals contribute to modern-day racism by convincing themselves they are not racist and re-appropriating black culture in different ways, definitely worth exploring.  However, the film is all over the place in terms of tone (not the first time I've heard this complaint); it's a horror/satire/social commentary/sci-fi/thriller mish-mash that works most, but not all, of the time. The above themes are introduced well in the first two acts, but the third act turns into a sci-fi thriller less concerned about race and more about survival.  The humor initially struck me as repetitive: How many times can a character insist his friend has become a sex slave? Even though the character's making a point about actual slavery, it still gets stale.  The fact that I've thought so much about the movie, and especially how its themes translate to real-life liberal culture, is a testament to its power. It's very interesting to me to see how others think the movie takes place in a red state or that the Armitrage (sic?) family is somehow brainwashed.  Which leads me to my final point, which I know will cause some controversy. Every single white character in this movie is evil or awful. From what I recall about Us and Nope, that's largely the case as well. This is fine if the antagonists are well-developed, but they seem more like plot devices than actual people.  Basically, I think this is like an 8.5/10 movie -- but is often boosted in terms of reception because it arrived at such a culturally relevant time (when Trump came into office).  I can't help but compare it to Kathryn Bigelow's Detroit, which arrived around the same time and was basically a horror movie about the Detroit Riots in the 1960s. That movie was flawed, too (have to rewatch, but there was a white savior complex aspect) -- but I felt it was much more intense and showcased stronger writing, as well as deeper characters. My reaction to that was very visceral; I remember leaving the theater thinking This is the best movie of the year.  **EDIT:** I don't remember Us other than the scissors and scratchy voice and the final image. Nope was super meh and really cheated us out of a Charla Nash comedy. What a thoughtful discussion this was. I leave you with these two top comments from the New York Times' Best Movies of 2022 article -- which, if it makes you happy, saw Nope claim the No. 1 spot.  You know you're allowed to criticize Jordan Peele, right? We don't need to pretend that the epically lackluster Nope is as good as his other films. If someone said Get Out was the third best movie the year it came out, yeah that would make sense. But Nope was just bad.  Nope? Are you serious? The movie is illogical and silly, if anyone else had directed it you would be awarding it razzies. The characters do not grow or change--indeed, they are barely characters at all, with a goal (selling a photo??) that is absurd and unrealistic. The cruel, unnecessary scene with the monkey is disconnected to the story of the film--it is backstory to a side character that is barely in the film. Much of the film is too dark to see what's happening; the dialogue is mush-mouthed, and oblique to the point of being incomprehensible. The creature design is little more than a classic flying saucer with a hole in the bottom. There are no moments of emotion, or tension; the rules they establish are instantly violated with zero ramifications; and the ending is a cheat. No just a bad movie, but easily one of the worst movies I've seen in years, it makes US look coherent. I've never disagreed with the two of you more."

Even poor Mary Elizabeth Manstrantion got her one big scene, where she goes from being the normal one to being just as wacko with no explanation.   The best performance, in my mind, came from Michelle Pfeiffer as Elvira. She seemed to be the only one taking it seriously, adding subtlety to her character, but that only makes Pacino's overacting more obvious when they share scenes together.   Good comedy but not a good movie. I think this was a hit because it was entertaining to see and extremely violent."

        "body": "After having finally getting around to watching it, I can say it's definitely one of my favorite movies that I've watched all year. The movie managed to keep me on my heels the whole time with its constant pace, yet never managed to feel like a rushed film.  I feel as if every main actor executed their role well, especially Javier and JLaw.   Javier managed to portray a narcissistic obsessed creator, who disregarded the trouble strangers brought to his wife, who in this case is Mother Nature, and forgave and welcomed them as they kept coming. In the bible we also frequently see just how much God himself claims to be a jealous God, who wants his creation to give thanks and praise him, and though it may seem unfair to his wife, having the burden of continuously forgiving the people who are damaging your home, must bring upon lots of strain and isn't for the weak. We see how Javier couldn't care less about Earth (home), because just like in the bible,  Gods creation of humans are the most important to him, and the Earth we live on will soon be anew, hence the reason why we see a new girl at the end of the movie.   As for JLaw, her performance was amazing. Her constant panic and hyperventilating kept me on edge the whole movie, and it didn't let me slip away once. In this film she is seen as Mother Nature and how humans are constantly destroying and tearing her apart, with little to no thought of it at all. Her battle with the strangers that destroy her home, resemble the damage people on Earth do today. One of the things that stood out to me the most, is she doesn't look for the help of strangers at all. She hesitates and feels uneasy when Michelle's character was assisting her with laundry, told the one person who was 'helping' her paint, how it wasn't necessary in the slightest, and she kept exclaiming how she renovated that house all by herself. This lines up with our real life, because Mother Nature would only benefit with us out of the equation. Jennifer would thrive if it was just her and her husband left in the house, where he wasn't responsible and didn't interfere with the house construction.   I will say though, I like the relationship established between Jennifer and Javier. Since the concept of there being a Mother Nature in a biblical sense doesn't exist, Javier being God has the power to end and create a new Earth, which would be classified to us as a Mother Nature/Earth. We see this at the end when he ends Jennifers life and a different woman wakes up to him. As much power as Mother Earth has, she is inferior to God at all moments. God's creation covers over Earth and people.   To cover some of the other allegories and allusions, Ed and Michelle are a reflection of Adam and Eve and how as soon as they broke the stone (Forbidden Fruit), they were banished from the private room they kept in the house, just like in the bible Adam and Eve were banished from the garden. Their offspring Cain and Able are also depicted when one of their sons die due to head bashing of the doorknob (rock), which may or may not be the same doorknob that was broken off by Javier earlier in the film. The rush of people claiming to gain power when the house transitioned to an apocalyptic setting, also symbolizes the antichrist and how people will rush to claim power, when Jesus comes back and the markings they will put on people for following them  Overall I appreciated this movie a lot. I didn't think the meaning behind it was too complex for the average movie goer to not enjoy. I was scared that this was going to be a forced  pretentious film, but it wasn't at all. If you did think it was pretentious, I would like to know why"

I think this is one advantage shows have over movies, and more specifically ones from this century. I'm not talking about cult classics or films released 25-30+ years ago (some even 80 years) that are still in people's mouths to this day, but moreso this century since these past 2 decades have been the golden age of television.   I see the most popular films from the last 5 years and the most popular shows from the past 5 years and you'd immediately realize there are more shows being talked about than movies. Even take subreddits for example: How many big subreddits dedicated to shows have you seen? Then compare that to how many subreddits dedicated to certain movies, barely any if none apart from franchises.   Are there any movies you know that have a big loyal fan base which are still talked about? I'm obviously not talking about films from this year."

The sets of a local gang, young mother and the old man build up a bridge between past and present. The memories of suffocation caused by babies, her lust in an affair, and peeling oranges repeatedly haunted her and somehow lured her into unsensible acts. We could see how a woman is trapped, buried, and lost under the duties of a mother and lost her identity. And how trauma in the past influences our present choices.  &#x200B;  But after all, she unravels her knots tied in motherhood, or even more before, her sisterhood.

Diary of a Wimpy Kid Dog Days is the best movie in the franchise  now i wait as the threats come rolling in...  &#x200B;  &#x200B;  edit: i see a lot of people saying this is a troll post; it isnt, these are my real opinions. i have an explanation for each and every one of them.  &#x200B;  edit #2 i dont have time to explain them all but name one u want explained and ill explain it\\\\  &#x200B;  edit #3 i like to argue so dm me if u wanna talk abt one specific opinion"

Throughout the film, we see how the characters on the bullet train are all trapped in their own little bubbles, locked in a battle for survival with no regard for the lives of others. They are driven by their own selfish desires, whether it be for money, revenge, or personal gain.  But as the movie progresses, we see how their actions only serve to escalate the violence and chaos on the train. They are caught in a never-ending cycle of violence, with each act of aggression only leading to more retaliation and bloodshed.  In the end, the only ones who truly benefit from this chaos are the shadowy figures pulling the strings behind the scenes. They are the ones who profit from the destruction and pain of others, using their power and influence to manipulate the situation to their own advantage.  Through its portrayal of this destructive cycle of violence, Bullet Train serves as a warning against the dangers of unchecked power and the futility of violence as a means of solving problems. It reminds us that in a world where everyone is out for themselves, only the ruthless and the powerful will thrive.  So while some may see Bullet Train as just another action-packed thriller, I believe it has a deeper message about the dangers of unbridled aggression and the importance of empathy and compassion in a world that is becoming increasingly chaotic and unpredictable   What are your thoughts?

        "body": "As most are aware, there's been an increased push for more strong female leads and roles all around in Hollywood over the last decade or so. While I think this is obviously an overdue and noble pursuit, it's often resulted in studios going for badass girl-boss type characters while failing to write them as complex and multi-faceted. Certainly a step up from classic damsel in distress type roles females often occupied in many genres in the past, but this approach often results in flat roles that put female characters on an unrealistic pedestal that ultimately, in my opinion, fail to advance feminist ideals in the industry even though the intentions are good.  Certainly not the only approach, but one step I think screenwriters could take to create a more well-rounded diet for actresses today would be to attempt to write more great female villains. One of my favorite female performances of all time is Tilda Swinton in Michael Clayton. She's a cold embodiment of corporate greed and perfectly portrays the evil force in the world today of putting profits over people, but at the same time a convincingly flawed human dealing with her own internal struggles and anxieties. Absolute masterclass in acting as well as writing.  Just wanted to get the discussion started on this issue as I find it interesting from an artistic as well as sociological perspective, hope it's not too hot-button and sparks more of a discussion than debate. I'd love to hear any thoughts people have on what they'd like to see in the future of strong female roles in Hollywood or in the spirit of my example, some of their favorite female antagonists.

        "body": "*Mild spoilers for the film below*  I'm sure I'm not the only one who gave this 3.5hr 'exploration of a Belgian housewife's chores' a go in response to the BFI poll, where it's rocketed straight up to number one, and it's left me wondering *why now*? Citizen Kane, Vertigo, both hugely influential and uncontentious challengers for the top spot, but Jeanne Dielman is an achingly slow, experimental film that would put off your average viewer, whereas I think most of the other films on the list have at least some mainstream appeal alongside their artistic merit.  First, my impressions. I genuinely did enjoy the film and I definitely wouldn't say it's boring, at times it can become almost hypnotic like the rhythmic beat of train tracks going by. It's not entertaining exactly, but as long as you're in the mood for something a little more leisurely and contemplative then it's an easy enough watch. A rewarding one too.  Quick overview… we see our housewife going about her daily life in painstaking detail. A routine clearly refined over time down to mechanical precision. All her actions seem automated and perfunctory, with very little joy or expression, she's living largely to the beat of economic necessity. In focussing so closely on such minutia though we start to notice off-beats creep in. Her growing malaise, or perhaps frustration, is not depicted with emotional outbursts or verbal tirades, but instead with subtle shifts in her actions and mannerisms that convey her inner state. This is where the 'monotony' of the first day's routine pays off, as by familiarising ourselves with her fastidiousness, a later hair out of place or pot lid askew becomes as overt as a gun shot in any other film. Even that prolonged potato peeling scene becomes engaging; the sheer level of intimacy and familiarity we've developed forces empathy and you *feel* the apathy and weary resignation with which she goes about her task. There's a strong sense that the film is building to something but you're not quite sure what, which produces a 'soft tension' that keeps you engrossed.  In terms of themes, it obviously has a lot to say about the role of woman in society and I don't want to diminish or dismiss that message at all. However, I'm sure that particular theme has been talked about at length many times over, and that message was as true and pertinent in 2012 and 2002 (etc) as it is today, so personally I don't think it's why it's taken the top spot. Instead, I'm wondering if covid, and particularly lockdowns and other disruptions have pushed Jeanne Dielman to newfound relevance (finally getting to the point of this ramble XD).  Arguably the most profound impact of covid is that our own routines have been disrupted, and I think that's forced a lot of people to take stock of their lives. When living day to day, as Jeanne Dielman does, it's so easy to sink into comforting habits that carry you along. It's all too rare that we stop to consider our own satisfaction, sense of purpose or ambitions, they're sacrificed for a sense of reassuring predictability. Even as the mundanity wears us down though, we often don't notice until it becomes so prominent it warrants a label; stress, burnout, depression. I think covid brought to light a growing dissatisfaction with that way of life, a realisation that something, *anything*, has to change as humans aren't automatons. We can't dutifully perform the same tasks day in, day out without pause. Like Jeanne, eventually something has to give or else we break.  I think that's what I took from the film. A reminder to take some time to evaluate our own routines and life direction, and to consider whether it's taking us somewhere we want to go. Not that we're always given that level of agency of course, economic necessity plays a large role here too, but then that speaks to wider issues in society. Of course this probably isn't the film's original vision, but I hate to admit that I did resonate with the forced monotony of it all. I've certainly had long periods when I've coasted along without much thought until something derailed me, and then I've been amazed it didn't happen sooner. I guess every now and then, it's worth taking a stab at something new!"

        "body": "What is a modern style blockbuster? Well, I guess that sort of depends on your point of view but let's say anything made after 2001 counts (i.e. films released in 2001 don't count).  As to what counts as a blockbuster? I guess in theory a blockbuster ought to actually be successful, but just anything that's trying to be a blockbuster ought to count, in some sense.  I know some people find best and favourite to be different things, so if that's you, understand the following as my favourite:  * Inception * Casino Royale * Thor: Ragnarok * Interstellar * Inside Out * The Batman * Edge of Tomorrow * Ratatouille  * Toy Story 3 * Unstoppable  I also really liked Bullet Train but I maybe watched that too recently."

        "body": "I feel like it's been a common fact that nobody can create a sense of true adventure like LucasFilm Ltd. can.  I'm watching this to prep for the new Disney+ series, which looks masterful and epic. But I've always heard of this film, and I love Ron Howard (since I'm in the small minority who loves Solo: A Star Wars Story), so after watching this in its entirety, I'm happy to say that this was a lot of fun and I really liked how simplistic of a film it was. It wasn't too dense, but it was filled with personality and goofiness that had me feel nostalgic for old-school fantasy epics.  Warwick Davis is a living legend and he is instantly likable and charming as Willow Ufgood. Val Kilmer looks like he's having so much fun as Madmartigan, and Joanna Whitney is badass as Sorsha. I also really liked Jean Marsh as the wicked Queen Bavmorda. The rest of the supporting cast is also really solid, especially the Brownies, who were legitimately funny. The overall story and execution of this film is really interesting since at times it's super fun and lighthearted, then there are moments where it's straight up creepy and terrifying. Howard did a superb job at balancing these elements, and made for something unique.  The production design and editing is really good, and the writing is also great. The pacing in the first half is a bit slower than I expected, but it ramped up as the film continues. The visual effects and the practical effects were decent, however, there are many times where it looks extremely dated. Like, how the Brownie's green screen effect shows at times, and when a certain scene where Raziel gets knocked down, I could clearly see it's a stunt actress with a old woman mask on. I could give things like this a pass, but they were super noticeable. Also, rest in peace to composer, James Horner. This score is one of his best and is super catchy to the point of me humming the theme to myself afterwards.  Overall, what a mystical and wonderful film. Now, I'm ready for the legacy series.  What did you guys think about this film?"

        "body": "Ahh, there's nothin' quite like early 2000's Disney. I have a weird history with this film since I would always see the trailer for it before watching one of those classic Disney DVDs with “Disney FastPlay”. It looked cool and reminiscent to Atlantis: The Lost Empire, but I never got a chance to watch it. Until now…  In a nutshell, this animated film has a very ambitious world where there's creatures and animals as a pirate crew with a talking robot and a blob that can morph into tiny versions of things. Just tons of odd ideas that somehow became cool as the film continues, even to the fact that I've never seen a pirate sci-fi adventure ever on film. It's clear that the novel and animators worked their butt off, creating a world in one film and executing it in a fun way. It's not perfect since there are some semi-annoying things in it, I'm just happy Disney made something super unique.  The voice acting is really solid, and I recognized quite a bit of them like Joseph Gordon-Levitt, Martin Short, Emma Thompson, and Michael Wincott. The characters are mostly really good, but for me, John Silver might be one of the most complex characters in Disney history. He's an antagonist for most of this film, but he has a really good heart and is a sort of surrogate father figure to Jim Hawkins. I really loved his character development, and he really was the strongest character in the whole film for me. The only characters that kind of made me annoyed was B.E.N. and Morph, while I think Martin Short is hilarious, he just was used way too much and I didn't really care that much about Morph.  The score by James Newton Howard is absolutely incredible, and I can't help but love the use of that 2000s pop rock. Especially “I'm Still Here (Jim's Theme)”, what a track! The use of CGI and 2D animated, while a bit dated, paints this imaginative world well. But there are times where CGI pops in, and it's super jarring. The writing is fine, but the relationship between Jim Hawkins and John Silver holds this film together. I love the use of orange and blue coloring in this, it's super ethereal and wonderful. The pacing was decent, but I felt some of the humor didn't land for me. Lastly, the third act is very bombastic and visually astonishing, but I just felt like there needed to be a bit more. It just felt a tiny bit underwhelming.  But overall, this was definitely a pleasant experience. Glad I got to see it.  What did you guys think about this film?"

I mean cmon...in 2006 he was a depressed teenager with very little diologue in Little Miss Sunshine and 1 year later worked alongside DDL in There will be Blood and absolutely held his own with one of the greatest ever? That's a feat very few could do.  Second is Travis Fimmel. This man was a damn underwear model....AN UNDERWEAR MODEL. I have no idea how he nailed the lead role in Vikings, but anyone who has watched the show will tell you how good he is. I've been watching film for 31 years and I can confidently say Travis's performance in the show was some of the greatest acting I've ever seen in cinema. I almost don't want to call it acting because I'm convinced he WAS Ragnar Lothbrok. I'm sure this is also in part due to the fantastic writing of the show and his character development."

As a Bay film, I basically had zero expectations and the mixed reviews didn't do nothing to help that. Still I gave it a try , and was totally surprised at how I ended up liking it. Not a perfect film but liked the performances, action scenes and basically it was entertaining.   Another one was The Lost City. Maybe it's cuz of Brad Pitt's cameo, I ended up loving it, more than I thought I would. Felt different from the more CGI filled blockbusters of the modern era.  There are other films that would have surprised me if I hadn't seen any reviews like Everything Everywhere All At Once and Top Gun Maverick."

And after watching it, all three and a half hours of it, I am convinced that it is a massive troll campaign.  Gut Opinion: Why would I want to see a woman peeling potatoes on film in real time  when I can watch a woman peeling potatoes at home?  Nothing happens in the movie. It is not ellipsis or exaggeration, absolutely nothing happens. It is a woman doing her daily life in real time. Seeing her wash the dishes, cook, eat with her son, go shopping, the only thing that comes out of the ordinary is that she does sex work, but that's part of that routine.  There is no conflict except in the last twenty minutes, the woman must find a button for her son's jacket that was sent to her by her aunt who lives in Canada.  And here is the big problem; there is no stylization; i.e, reality is not filtered or paraphrased, there is no work of mimesis, it is unaltered daily life, there is an ellipsis of time, if it didn't, the film would last seventy-two hours, but it pretends not to, by showing the actions in real time.  The second is ; in other slow and boring films the actions are loaded, that is, there is a great purpose, they are directed towards an end, that is why we put up with them. Here, they do not have that end. It is the absolute ennui.  And what is more French than that?  On the second day things go wrong, the coffee does not taste good and the woman prepares it again, but there is no reason for it, there is a whole level of inner life that is completely alien to us, we do not know the reason for the action in the literally last eighth minute, and in the last seven minutes the woman is just sitting at the dining room table.  The only extraordinary action, which would have any kind of impact on her life from that moment on, just happens.  Jeanne Dielman, 23 quai du Commerce, 1080 Bruxelles cannot be the greatest movie of all time because it lacks two things that every movie should have; stylization and conflict.  The message of the panel that gave it such a distinction is that the best story that cinema can tell is none, it is to be a mere portrait of reality, without altering, without commenting, without stylizing, without glamorizing, without editing. And as such, any interpretation or allegory is valid because the film is like a cloud. When you are doing a daily and repetitive action your mind wanders off. Any comment or review, then, will not be about the film itself, but about the person who tells you about it and their idiosyncrasy.  &#x200B;  If you want to see feminism, it will be there because you brought it.   I am aware that by writing this I am telling you something about myself. and that is the artistic intention.   But I think the purpose of cinema is telling stories and take us to the realm of the extra-ordinary.  If I wanted ordinary I have a lot of it at home."

Even if you're against the idea of a sequel... we all know shameless sequels get made regardless( Kindergarten Cop 2). So I'm surprised Phone Booth has gone untouched.

Personally, I think sequels for this film COULD work. Maybe following along with Saw; have multiple victims in phone booths at one time who have to work together. Maybe have a 'Phone Booth Game' akin to Dirty Harry. Heck, maybe evolve it to a mobile phone or something in later sequels. I think the killer was interesting enough to carry a few more movies."

Also, on a similar note, Scott's *Napoleon* is the first such historical epic about him in years. If this does turn out to be widely successful (ignoring the lukewarm response to his *Last Duel*), do you think it will lead to another cycle of historical epics?  &#x200B;  EDIT: Thanks for the comments. I was thinking more about a possible revival of the project, perhaps in the form of the long mooted HBO series.  Obviously, it won't correspond exactly to Kubrick's original intention (especially the spectacle side of things - e.g. battle sequences -  which would most likely need a lot of CGI), but at least the project will have technically been made in a sense. Plus, given the Napoleonic era is so history-rich, a miniseries is probably the better option if you want to show his entire life and not cut too much out.  Regarding Kubrick's intended vision, I'd imagine any potential director would need to get the family's approval, etc. around certain things (let alone viewing the existing material), so the final product might not be too bad if things go well."

And like at the end the girl is talking to some new friend about the things she sees. I'm trying to wrap my brain around the ploy but I'm only remembering bits and pieces. it kinda reminds me of the last mimzy (2007) but idk if that's just me.

        "body": "I just finished watching Robert Eggers' *The Lighthouse* and I was blown away. One thing that stood out to me was the characters referring to one another as dog or in other canine ways. Throughout the first two acts, there are multiple instances where Thomas Wake refers to Thomas Howard/Ephraim Winslow as a dog. The first mention is when Wake asserts his power to Howard, telling Howard that he'll do whatever he tells him to and he'll like it cuz I says you will! Contradict me again, and I'll dock your wages. Swab, dog, swab. Later, Howard reveals to Wake that when he was working as a logger that goddamned Canady bastard \\[the real Ephraim Winslow\\] always called me a dog. A filthy dog. I'll show you a dog. I'll show you whose a dog. This anecdote makes it clear to the audience, and evidently to Wake, that this term gets under Howard's skin. The term represents the power other people exert onto Howard, a man who yearns for the day he can be free from obligation and dependence. Later, when Howard recounts the death of the real Ephraim Winslow, we remarks that the last thing he yelled to him was Tom, you dog! During one of the film's major turning points when Wake confronts Howard about killing the gull and Howard denies it, Wake shouts that he is a murdering dog! Twas what changed the wind on us. Twas ye what damned us, dog. Twas ye! Moments later, Wakes continues his verbal assault, telling Howard that Winslow were right! Thomas, ye're a dog! A filthy dog! A dog! It is upon the delivery of this line that Pattinson's character lunges at Dafoe's, sending them sprawling onto the wooden floor. After Howard leaves Wake in a huddled in pain on the floor, he stands directly over him and commands him to bark like a dog. Bark, boy, bark Howard insists. After a pause, Wake's meager woof marks what I believe to be the final stage of the shift in power dynamic between the two men. Whatsmore, after Wake's woofing, Howard asks him whose a good boy and to roll over in the same way a dog-owner would speak to their canine. What follows is an extreme, but powerful representation of just how drastically the power has shifted in Howard's favor. As he walks into the foreground, we see his is holding a rope lead on the end of which is Wake crawling on all fours like a dog. Here, Eggers makes no attempt at subtlety to convey the power Howard seems to wield in the two men's relationship. No longer is he the one being treated like a dog as if he is less than human. Now he is the one who holds the leash and dictates the other man, both literally and metaphorically. Notably, the raging tempest that dominates the film after Howard kills the gull seems to have completely dissipated. Pointing to the empty pit at the base of the lighthouse, he orders  Wake to get in there; where you belong. You do as I say, dog. Howard proceeds to shovel direct on top the old wickie. Now it was at this moment in the film that I expected Wake to break. I expected an increasingly tearful scene where Wake begs to be spared while Howard basks in the victory of literally burying the only obstacle that stands between him and the light. But as heaps of dirt are stacked onto his beaten body, Wake does not fuss nor cry. Instead, he is remarkably calm and seems to taunt Howard, asking his if he wishes to see what's in the lantern? before delivering one of the film's most memorable monologues in which he laments about what Protean forms swim up from men's mind and melt into hot Promethean plunder, scorching eyes and divine shames and horror and casting them down into Davy Jones. The others, still blind, yet in it see all the divine graces ... Them's truth. You'll be punished.  &#x200B;  I am wondering what you all think about the significance of dog name calling and references throughout the film? Is it used by Eggers to portray the rapid shift in the two men's power dynamic? What does it say about Thomas Howard's struggle to assert his identity? Based on Wake's calm demeanor and ominous monologue as Howard buries him, do you think there was a shift in power to begin with or does it just appear that way to Howard because he is the one who now holds the leash? Did Wake know that Howard was doomed from the beginning and will inevitably succumb to the fatal truth that awaits him atop the lighthouse? Does the light represent truth, which is why it kills Howard - a man averse to the truth?"

        "body": "Just some preamble. I'm an American, so maybe that's where most of my gripes come from. Although this movie is Icelandic, I believe, it's set in modern times, and although they live in the countryside, there is reason to believe, there is a metro/City area nearby so yeah. So I'm fully aware of any culture barriers, but I just dubunked them, so yeah. There are a few other posts on Reddit, discussing this movie, but not many. This post will contain spoilers, if you haven't seen it yet.  I first heard about Lamb, through one of those text to speech film recap channels on YouTube. (Which I hate, as they spoil the movie in the title, and spoil the movie in the recap video. Lol. They are also very viral, these types of videos. I can't stand it. Lol.) I had to stop watching the recap, to avoid being spoiled, and just add the film to my watchlist. The plot seemed interesting, as I like more morbid twisted psych thriller/horror stories. Etc. I finally rented it online this weekend. I was so disappointed, and I feel the film was very bad, and made no sense.  Assuming you all have seen the film, and know the plot. There are several avenues which list the sypnosis online. Because I'm just going to generalize, from this point forward. It's about a couple, Ingvar, and Maria, who have this large farm property in Iceland, where their home is adjacent to their farm business. One of their sheep, give birth to a half sheep, half human, hybrid offspring. They name her Ada, and raise her like a human child. Ingvar's brother Petur, later moves in with them.   First the good, and what I liked.  I loved the cinematography. I loved the location, their house, the farming business aesthetic. I loved how a lot of modern technology references were used (Petur shocked they still have VHS tapes in their living room). I liked the CGI they used for Ada. I liked how based on the production side of things, I felt I was at their farm/barn etc. So yeah.  Now onto what I didn't like.  I don't like how this is a movie, where you have to assume, and guess everything.  Ingvar and Maria, who are, Husband and Wife, farmers, help Ada's mother/the pregnant Lamb, we saw in the first scene staggering into the barn. However we see expressions of concerns on their faces, but we dont know what Ada's condition, or appearance is. We later find out, deep into the film, the lower portion of her body is human female, but the upper part, her head, arms, chest, are Lamb/sheep etc. Very confusing.  Ingvar and Maria immediately decide to adopt Ada as their daughter. (Which I understand they had a miscarriage earlier, but still) With no discussion of calling the news, no awkward phase. Both of them thinking a lamb/human hybrid is normal etc. Very perplexing.  Ada runs away several times. You think they would lock their front door, or put a leash on her. Hated how every other scene, Ingvar or Maria are in haste, as Ada ran out the house again.  Ingvar's brother Petur, is introduced, in a confusing way. You see a bunch of guys throw his wallet and phone into the wilderness, and kick him out the car. Is he in a secret mafia group? Is he a musician? Until Ingvar said Ada, this is Uncle Petur, I had suspicions he was his Brother, but we could only assume  All we know is Maria had an affair with him at one point. Feel this could have been better setup. Lol.  Maria kills Ada's mother, because she constantly pesters and follows, Ingvar and Maria, as she's depressed, they took her baby away, of course. Don't like how they wouldnt let her interact with Ada still. Etc.   Petur's reaction to Ada, is simply literally only, The fuck, and yet, he accepts Ada, and has a good relationship with her. He doesn't immediately run to the press, or city to reveal this secret? Yeah right.   Ada ages and grows up, at least a couple of years, by the time Petur moves in. So Ingvar and Maria's plan, was to always keep her hidden? Ada wears little girl human clothes. She has really good cognitive abilities. She can do chores around the house. She eats human food. She can watch TV, and dance. She is constantly cuddling either Ingvar, Maria, or Petur. She understands Icelandic. Etc. What about school for Ada. What about putting her on Iceland Got Talent etc. How long did they expect this secret gig to go on?  The really gross, uneeded, and out of place, sex scene between Ingvar and Maria, which was parallel edited to Petur and Ada downstairs in the living room, dancing and watching the music video channel on TV, was so cringe.   Petur tries to seduce Maria. She rejects his advances, and Peter just leaves in acceptance amicably. Keeping the Ada secret. Okay. Lol.   Climax ending scene. Igvar while out doing field work with Ada helping him, is shot and killed, by a half ram, half human like man, we assume is Ada's father. He also kills their dog for no reason. Smh. But I assumed it would have had to been a more human looking being, to be the father. The ram looked way too feral, and didnt have much humanoid features, unless he can shape shift, and we don't know. The ram drops the gun, and carries Ada away. Maria appears later, and is in total confusion. The end. No more explanations. Lol.  Feel this movie although cinema wise, was okay, just story wise. It wasn't that good. I feel maybe if this story were set in America, Ada would have been a reality star, and it would have been a different setup. Seems for no reason, the couple has no direction or plan for her. Petur/Uncle appears, and acts like Ada is a dog/cat, and doesn't feel creeped out, or intrigued. He's just whatever about it. Petur leaves on happy terms. Ada's assumed father is perturbed, and takes her away, killing Ingvar. Maria is just left with so many unanswered thoughts and questions. That's it. I don't know man. Smh. Lol.  Strange movie, but those are my gripes with it. Leave any comments please, if you guys agree/disagree. Thank you. :)"

So looking back over the Oscar award for Best Original Score I was pretty shocked that they both lost. Inception lost to The Social Network and Interstellar lost to The Grand Budapest Hotel. Both The Social Network and Grand Budapest have great soundtracks but they aren't as memorable.   Hans Zimmer felt like he was innovating with these two scores. Inception using a big orchestra of Brass players to emphasize the notion of time slowing down and making the score sound even more epic. Which went on to be copied A LOT. Then Interstellar utilizing a vast array of organ pipes and also incorporating the notion of a ticking clock into the soundtrack to subconsciously instill a sense of anxiety into the audience. Most of the score was so emotionally charged that it felt like it linked together Cooper and Murph, despite them being galaxies apart. Along with most of the tracks within these two scores being bangers. Like No Time for Caution or a random chase scene in Inception having the best chase music ever called Mombasa.  When you compare these two soundtracks to The Social Network and Grand Budapest it surprises me who ended up winning. Between the two though maybe Grand Budapest would have a chance, but still."

My aunt was the one watching, I really didn't want to as the little girl in it creeped me out, and she is the only real thing I remember from it.   – She wore a wig, and a mask. I believe she also wore a dress, with stockings, and dress shoes, but that part is vague at best.   – When it was revealed that she was burned, her father informed the 'guests' that it as punishment for being a bad girl.   – She never really spoke, but squealed when expressing her dissatisfaction.   – in the movie she appeared to be really sweet, but still gave the guests a weird vibe.   – she liked to sit on her dad's lap at the head of the table   Considering the info I remember, I can only assume it was a horror of some type, but as I stated before I was just a kid.

Now, don't get me wrong, I am not saying he does only bad or forgettable movies, but I am saying that he mostly does.  Obviously, we have his stand out hit/franchise Deadpool.  It seems that since Ryan Reynolds became a big star, his name was always attached to this character, and it was essentially handed to him on a plate, and he didn't disappointed.  He is perfect for the role.  The handling of the character was bad in his first outing (Wolverine), but since then it has been handled great.  He will forever be attached to Deadpool and that will keep him elevated as a big star and he'll likely never needs to work again if he so wishes.  But, most of his list of work just isn't great, with some minor exceptions.  Safe House was amazing.  It was very much in the same mould as the Jason Bourne action thrillers, but it worked on it's own.  More recently, Free Guy was a huge hit for Ryan Reynolds too.  I loved Buried, but many did not.  I am not too fond of the Hitman's Bodyguard myself, but I think audiences did respond well.  Despite these few exceptions, I just feel he is very bad at choosing roles.  Some of his films are very weird (not in a good way), and downbeat, and lifeless.  I don't know how else to explain them.    Another name that comes to mind is Chris Hemsworth.  Again, don't get me wrong, he of course has Thor behind him, as well as other related MCU movies (Thor to Hemsworth is much like Deadpool to Reynolds), but he has a long long list of utterly forgettable bad movies that just don't work in any way.  Again, with a few exceptions here and there, I feel he is very bad at choosing projects.  Do you agree with what I've said?  Do you have any other actors in mind who mostly do bad movies?  EDIT:  Related question:  what is the deal with Ryan Reynolds taking smaller roles in other people's movies?  The most recent example is in Hobbs and Shaw for all of two minutes.  Bullet Train.  Ted.  Life.  Criminal.  A Million Ways To Die In The West.  The list goes on."

        "body": "In the world of cinema, lighting is often an overlooked but essential element that can greatly enhance a film's visual aesthetic and help tell its story more effectively. One such example is the 1972 classic, The Godfather.  Directed by Francis Ford Coppola, The Godfather is a crime drama that follows the rise of the Corleone family, one of New York's most powerful mafia clans. The film is known for its complex characters, dramatic plot twists, and stunning visuals, and the lighting plays a key role in creating its mood and atmosphere.  One of the standout aspects of the lighting in The Godfather is its use of contrast. The film often features dark, shadowy scenes that create a sense of mystery and danger, while also highlighting the characters' emotions and inner turmoil. This is particularly evident in the famous scene where Michael Corleone (played by Al Pacino) kills a rival mafia boss in a dimly lit restaurant.  But the lighting in The Godfather is not just about creating a mood - it also helps to establish the film's setting and time period. The film is set in the 1940s and 1950s, and the lighting plays a crucial role in conveying this through its use of warm, golden tones and soft, diffused light. This gives the film a timeless, nostalgic quality that helps transport viewers to the world of the Corleone family.  Overall, the lighting in The Godfather is an integral part of the film's success. It adds depth and dimension to the story, and helps to create a rich, immersive experience for viewers. It's a prime example of how effective lighting can elevate a film from good to great."

To be fair, there were some parts I liked.  The opening credits were great, the cast is mostly good, the casino scene was cool, and the zombie trap bit was funny."

Every piece of foreground and background art and the themes and stories and characters have been thought about more then anyone should.  But overtime I've realized a few things. That Andy and Sid's fathers aren't present in the movie. In an interview Andy's dad has passed away is why he isn't there according to the writers. Sid's family seems more like his father and mother divorced or he was never there.   Why do I bring this up? Because I've decided that the movie is actually a comparison for how these two kids treat their toys and the people in their lives without a father figure to guide either of them. We see Sid being bad always, tortures toys, tortures his sister, and does whatever he wants. He was at Pizza Planet alone and road his skateboard him alone at night. Also he order a large firework rocket that explicitly says keep out of reach of children. Andy's mom brought him to Pizza Planet unlike Sid's mom. Then Sid asks his mom for matches and says never I got them and she never comes to see what he's burning or raises concern to stop him. This is showing how the nurture aspect has been so different for them. That Andy's mom is trying to make it okay for her son without the father there. And Sid's mom isn't really present, my assumption is from depression from her whole situation.  The reason why the story focuses on the toys instead mostly is because they were easier to animate at the time since everything looked like plastic so they decided to animate things that should be plastic. Then they just use the lives of the toys and how they feel about the kids to further build on the hidden underlying theme.  Have I seen this too many times? Yes. Please send help. If you'd like to discuss this more then let's see what you think. Have a great day with the kiddos everyone."

Despite the cringe romance of the film and the awkward editing here and there, the film was a massive financial success. It essentially launched the superhero movie genre into the stratosphere. It doesn't change the fact that someone that average has been able to be that successful. She must have an amazing agent."

They really use it to their advantage, kinda like Collateral.  Solid performances too. RDJ is firmly in Tony Stark mode here and seeing him do that in a different kind of movie was fun. And this might actually be my favorite Val Kilmer performance. His acerbic delivery is spot on but I actually kinda bought him as a detective too. I thought Michelle Monaghan overcooked it a few times with the drama and overacting, but not by much, and it does kind of work for the tone they're going for.  I will say, I did really like the narration, and it's necessary to complete the homage to 50s noir he's doing here, but I think Shane Black uses it as a crutch a couple times.   There's a few moments where Harry acknowledges that something is a plothole or a cliché, and that meta acknowledgment through narration is meant to hand wave any issues. It was funny, but it did also feel like a bit of a cheap way to quickly write yourself out of any corner.  But yeah, overall it's funny, the story's interesting, and even though it's not an action movie, the few scenes of it that are there are well-filmed. Particularly the climax on the bridge I thought was quite cool."
