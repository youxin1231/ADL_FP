And he's convinced by a prostitute to use his powers to fight crime. It's one of those lower-budget movies, and it's a wild ride from start to finish, not the sort of thing that would ever make it into theaters for the general public.   It makes me curious to those who find this post, What's the most memorable bad movie you've ever seen? Could be b-movies, low-budget movies, movies that are honestly trying but just not cutting it, etc. I'd love to know what else is out there."

        "body": "I've been putting off seeing The Mist for literally over a decade but finally got around to it- holiday movie season and all.  I'd been hearing all about this great twist forever, and how King liked it better than his own ending, so admittedly my expectations were moderately high.  We get started and my brain starts immediately connecting dots- our main man is a scifi artist, spooky military fog happens, and all of a sudden we've got unseen scifi monsters roaming about.   Then we get evidence of one of the creature's tentacles- but it mysteriously disappears when the strong-minded guy who doesn't believe in that shit comes to look.  Then crazy lady starts telling everyone it's bible shit and we get swarms of locusts. She believes that God will save her when one of them lands on her, and in response to her prayers it flies off and leaves her alone. People start listening to the main guy, and then to her, and the more scared people are and the more they believe, the crazier shit gets.   By the end I was 100% convinced that the mist was a military experiment or otherdimensional phenomenon used to manifest people's fears and beliefs into reality, responding most strongly to those with the strongest imaginations/personal realities (the artist, the pragmatist, the madwoman.)  It was such a beautiful metaphor- the mist as a physical manifestation of humanity's imaginations and their fear of the unknown. Showing how mob mentality takes us over, and an individual's reality can be subsumed by groupthink (the pragmatist who later gets killed at the pharmacy.) Warring ideologies made manifest. How humanity is often its own worst enemy, allowing our fears to drive us to create a reality that's so much worse than it needs to be (since none of that shit would have happened if they could've stopped being fear-driven dicks for like 5 seconds.)  But no, the bullshit “fog dimension to an alternate monster universe” strawman is actually what they decided to go with, ~~with pointless killing of a kid thrown in to boot (and by the way did they HAVE to make the kid wake up in time to see his dad shoot him? Dicks.)~~  Fuck you, whoever came up with that lame ass ending.  /rant   Edit: It seems like everyone is fixating on the kid killing thing. That was a bit of a throwaway comment, sorry to trigger y'all. Up with the kid deaths in media.  My main bone is with what the mist eventually wound up being- a portal to interdimensional monsters rather than an allegorical tool manifesting the fears and internal realities of those who come into contact with it."

I don't work in aviation, but I would think that the aircraft tower is a strictly controlled environment, and anyone not working there would be denied access or removed immediately.    3)  How does a 747 that's virtually out of fuel blow up like the fourth of July?    4) How does nobody hear repeat gunfire in a busy airport?  No alarms are raised from the shootouts?    5) John McClane aimed a machine gun directly at a security guard and opened fire to show the gun used blanks.  I was taught you never point a gun at a person like this.  It immediately took me out of the scene."

Anyway, what sparked this off is that i recently found my old VHS tape of jurassic park (my fave film), i've watched it a lot on streaming, dvd, blu ray ect. I thought i'd watch it on VHS and i honestly think the VHS and dvd versions of the movie are unmatched because of how imperfect and sort of dirty the film looks. Maybe the grit hides imperfections and makes everything blend in better? who knows  is it stupid of me to say that movies are too good looking now? is that stupid?

The writing, the plot, the directing, the acting (by almost all of the old cast!), the characters...the lack of your typical Hollywood tropes and CGI stupidity....I'm blown away. There were so many different ways they could've screwed it up but it went the opposite way. They even managed to turn Ralphie's wife and kids into genuinely likeable characters in their own right who fit in with the style of the movies. I laughed hysterically...I even shed a mini tear (IT WAS JUST A DROP DAMMIT!). I can't remember any Xmas movie I genuinely wanted to watch again besides the first Christmas Story, and now this.

Some of my favorites is the motorcycle chase with the cop at the beginning of First Blood and pretty much every car chase in Ronin is amazing.

If Grand Budapest Hotel is pattern and symmetry, The French Dispatch is stylized asymmetrical symmetry and balance. (at least that's how my One art class brain saw it)Each scene is designed with enough intricate detail to convince me that Wes Anderson is an artistic genius. And you can really chew on the dialogue in both movies. They will also remind you of your poor vocabulary. Grand Budapest is a fast-paced, unrealistic adventure drama, while French Dispatch is a slower “love letter to journalists that brings a collection of stories to life.” I went down a rabbit hole reading about Wes Anderson. He's written and directed nine other movies with the same A-list actors. Another is coming out next year with Benedict Cumberpatch called The Wonderful Henry Sugar I plan to watch every movie within the next few weeks."

He says “Belle, it's me” and she looks at him with confusion and not believing what she physically just witnessed. She has to touch his hair and look at him further even though just a few seconds ago she watched him physically transform in front of her.  If she was not physically next to him when he transformed back, this reaction would have been a lot more believable, but the fact she saw it happen never sat well with me.

Another kind of silly movie to watch that not many people talk about that's considered a B rated horror would be Rubber. *Spoilers* It's literally about a tire with psychic powers that can make people's heads explode and goes around killing people for the mistreatment of tires. This is when you as a viewer find out it's a movie within a movie for whatever reason. It's another watch it for the silliness of it all type of movie.

It honestly feels like the futurama joke of a film in slow motion, nothing of interest happens the entire time. Characters just seem to get on with the plot, and the plot is the most generic blockbuster plotline I've ever seen, especially when you consider at least the standard generic blockbuster has a bloody ending! This film just stopped and I remember being in the cinema, everyone clapping and being happy and that and just thinking what the fuck did we see a different film? It was the worst movie I've ever seen in the cinema and that includes when I saw Grown Ups 2 with Adam Sandler (at least it was half the length and had jokes that even if they didn't make you laugh got some kind of reaction out of you).  I tried watching it again today and I had to turn it off an hour and a half in. Even the beautiful cinematography the film is praised for feels dull to me. Big empty halls of brown with a bit of light, and characters that sit there reading the script with zero emotion. Nothing stands out, there's a 10 minute long bit where he talks to a gardener and the gardener is like these trees are so important then the trees get burnt down half an hour later and it was filmed like that was a big emotional moment. Seriously, whilst I weren't a fan of the book I could at least understand who it was after, it had a great plot with complicated characters and there was no clear good guys and bad guys. But in this film the good guys go out of their way to save people, and the bad guys all look like nazis living on their big nazi planet. Fuck me. What a waste of time, not for me watching it, but for all the cast and crew that spent months/years of their life on the most intricately painted yellow/grey wall ever."

It turned out that there is something at least barely something that would have been watchable about the movie 'cause a lot of people obviously went to the theatres and gave their money to watch it.  While box office is not always the best criteria, most of the times it does work. The Shawshank Redemption is one of the few movies that consistently reminds me that Box Office is not everything.  When it comes to movies on streaming though, it's based on Word of Mouth from Youtube. I've found that rotten tomatoes reviews and even Top 10 trending charts don't matter cause the former most of the times is too less and the latter can be easily manipulated by the streamer. Mostly the streaming movies sucked but I came to love Tomorrow War and Do Revenge based on YouTube recommendations.  I sometimes use critic reviews and IMDb reviews in case of tie breaks. What is your criteria for picking a movie to see?"

You get introduced to potentially cool characters, namely the legacy characters from the first movie, as they are gathered to celebrate their surviving Michael's wrath decades prior.   We are then brought to the inferno that was Laurie's house, firemen arrive, Michael opens that sliding door to reveal himself, then he slaughters them all in super cool ways and I do wish we got to see him kill them all.....  Then we see him go to that old couple and he kills the husband, nearly kills the wife but she survives as seen in Ends of course.....  After this the movie only goes from bad to worse, suffering from really bad writing, characters being total dumbasses, cringey Shakespearean dialogue, severe lack of logic all over, and the ending being completely meaningless given everything that happens in Ends. Plus.....they fucked that mob mentality subplot up all to hell because of the actor they went with for that.....the Penguin, instead of someone who could pass for James Jude Courtney's stunt double or something.

        "body": "So I rewatched Bad Santa tonight as part of my yearly tradition of watching Christmas movies leading up to the big day, and it is awesome, it is, in my opinion, one of best and most funniest Christmas movies ever made, and, as can be guess, still holds up extremely well.  For many reasons, such as Billy Bob Thortons performance, his characters dynamic with the kid being very well done and believable, the kid himself, whole you could argue can be alittle bit annoying at times, still very sincere and still feels like a realistic portrayal of a kid, and his nonchalant reactions to Willys outburst are just hilarious, to the other characters also being very memorable, to the comedy just being so funny, like, I was laughing like crazy throughout the film.  But I think the reason I move it the most, is that despite it being a very un-convential Christmas movie, it actually has a very positive and feel good message. Yes it does have raunchier humor and darker moments, but at its core it still has a great message about not being alone, Bonding with others, and changing for the better. It's kindof like an R-rated version of the Grinch, actually. So despite being a Un-Convential Christmas film, still manages to also feel like a traditional Christmas film simultaneously as well. Also, it's just a really funny movie. My favorite scenes being with the kid with the ice cream, his freak out in the food court, and the scene of him driving the kid back home.   So yeah, great movie, easily one of the funniest Christmas movies of all time, but also one of my top 5 most favorite/best Christmas/holiday movies of all time. I couldn't recommend it enough."

The script is very good, but the direction actively hindered my ability to be affected by the characters' plight. The camera moves without reason and slow motion shots / melodramatic music jars you in moments that would otherwise be impacting. Every time I was being pulled into the film, the director would do some unnecessary and unenjoyable stylistic flourish that pulled me out and reminded me I was watching a movie.  Awhile ago I watched a movie, based on a play, that entirely takes place at a police station as a black mother and her white detective husband grapple with the news that their son has been killed by cops. I was continually distracted because the director could not just plant the camera and let the actors convey, reserving the camera movement for when it would be most powerful tool. Instead, the camera was constantly tracking in, out and laterally for absolutely no reason whatsoever. Camera movements convey meaning and, when a director is aware of how the camera motion will affect the audience, can be used to greatly enhance the viewer's experience: random camera movements do the opposite.  Anyways, I thought I'd vent and get downvoted. Can you think of any movies with great scripts and bad direction?"

That got me wondering, what makes a theater experience essential for some films.  It's not like that this is an underdeveloped idea. Using another film from this year, I saw countless number of people saying that Top Gun: Maverick was meant to be seen in theaters. I watched it in one and loved it, but I still don't know what makes it more essential than other films on the big screen. There's definitely spectacle that other films don't have, but that seems somewhat subjective at least.  What do you guys consider a film “made for the big screen”?"

        "body": "Spoilers :   Many people have noted the similarities between these films : a group of outside observers stumble onto a community at which point, with a building sense of dread, they uncover the dark, violent intensions that this group has for them. Both prey on a sense of guilt that is uncovered in the protagonists. Both engage in a violent reaction against consumerist, egotistical modern society. And both , of course, end in fire. However, despite the similarities, I think that the two communities, the Chefs and the Swedish village, represent radically opposite political idealogies: communism and fascism respectively.    Midsommar makes it references to fascism obvious. As soon as the anthropologists land in Sweden there is a huge banner advertising a far right anti-immigrant political party. The community, like fascism, is based in obscure mythical origins and a violent commitment to tradition. And it's appeal (as shown in the infamous crying scene) is based, like fascism, in the sense of community and belonging missing in the modern world.    The Menu is less obvious , but at least clear in the anti -capitalist designs of the chef collective. Ralph Fiennes chef repeatedly calls out how the rich and money pervert his restaurant. The bankers are selfish, corrupt, assholes. One character is labeled guilty just because she was rich enough to not have to take out student loans. The reduction of everyone to simply “chef” instead of their names mirrors the universalizing title of comrade in communism. There is no commitment to tradition, only an ideal. And like Stalinism, and unlike in Midsommar of fascism, the terrifying sense of guilt cannot be escaped, there is no one group that is elevated above the others, and even the chefs themselves carrying out this violence are guilty and have to die.    Some might call this a reach but I think at least the fact that both movies are very political is undeniable."

Also, *Dr Jekyll and Mr. Hyde* is in the public domain (the original book was written by Robert Louis Stevenson, and it was published in January 1886).  I know that, in comparison, *Treasure Planet* (2002, John Musker and Ron Clements) is a pastiche of *Treasure Island* (1883, also Robert Louis Stevenson) in a science-fiction context (a steampunk universe to be exact).  I would really want to watch a political science-fiction horror animated film made by WDAS based on *Dr Jekyll and Mr. Hyde*. It could be the first PG-13 film made by WDAS.

Reynolds is a bit better but he's not great.

Also most of the songs sound so...samey and generic. And the songs kind of overtake the movie; there are sections of the movie that are just songs, then long stretches where no singing happens, and then back to song to song back to back.  I kinda wish they just made it a straight out comedy, a sort of modern day Scrooged, rather than just making it a musical honestly."

American Psycho is just a movie about a psychopath who kills random innocent people, hide their bodies, and continues living his luxurious life.

Living in the Castle not being able to leave reminded me a lot of The Truman Show, which I also watched recently (wow to that movie too, definitely deserves it's own post) and there was so much to love. Seeing this old world slowly become Westernized. The bike, the glasses... and them speaking in English the entire time... I don't know why they decided to do that but it added to the surrealism, for better or worse.   The tutor was such a good character too. The wife was awesome too and that scene where the hands undress her as she kissed him... this movie was a fever dream in the best way at times. But then when they left the Castle, it felt like it became a different movie. The Emperor trying to hold onto his power, the only life he's ever known... I don't know enough about the history behind this, so I feel some of this was lost on me but it felt so tragic and I ended up hating and feeling bad for him. He's innocent, I can't blame him for holding onto the life he's ever known but he obviously made some bad decisions. But you can still see the love and goodness in him at odds with who he was taught to be.   Such a complex, fascinating and beautiful movie. Not to mention the SOUNDTRACK was so good. I knew Ryuichi Sakamoto from some other songs so when I saw his name I got so excited yet somehow I was still blown away.   Just wow, really. Such an amazing movie. I had to share my scattered thoughts as I'm on my commute.   How good are this directors other movies? Are there other historical movies that are worth watching in the same vein? I have no idea how accurate this movie was but it actually seems to be kind of honest, despite obvious dramatizations and artistic discretion. But I could be wrong"

It honestly surprised me how good it actually is, especially for a horror sequel from the 80s. It's genuinely creepy in parts (the rocking horse) and shocking (the locker room) and creative (the chalkboard whirlpool) and some wtf moments. It obviously took inspiration from Carrie, but it wasn't overly blatant. The acting is rather good as well and the special effects were well done for the time.

        "body": "**Spoiler warning**  First off I know I'm late this movies almost 2 years old   I'm trying to convince myself there's more to this movie but it screams Director gone too far in trying to be different without much constructive thought.   If you liked this movie I'd really like to know why and what you're take on it is because I honestly feel like I completely wasted 2 hours of life.    First of all.    Girl is chased on the road at night by a random car and forgets to call  authorities - or anyone.   The chaser stops his vehicle letting her get a sizeable lead on him.   He then creeps his car forward slowly to catch up because science dictates an object travelling 5 miles per hour can catch up to another object doing 30. That's how cars work.   The girl spots an empty gas station that's clearly closed - with her chaser far behind common sense tells her to get out of her vehicle and head to the gas station on foot.   Upon realising the gas stations closed she could get back into her car and speed off but decides she doesn't want to live so she sets off running into some weeds    The chaser at this point whose knowledge of speed has already been proven - slowly walks after the much younger woman whose running for her life.    The chaser is shown to be walking slowly in an area of flat land while the girl is running through weeds yet neither her or the truck driver who turns up see the person chasing her, we assume because the truck drivers never brought up.   We see fairly clearly that the chaser is a man, heavier set but not obese, straight walk, white male wearing a cap with facial hair and short head hair.    So this automatically rules out Albert, Jimmy or Deacon - right.  Ok.    At the end of the movie  Denzels character is still haunted by the past because he's made literally 0 strides in doing anything to solve that - ok?    Rami Maleks character is now also traumatised and kills someone - right.    Turns out Denzel also killed someone except it was a missing person….ok?    Cop and Coroner , fucking, cover up Denzels murder and were clearly willing to let whoever they found for the killings take the wrap for it and continue to let him work on the force - okedoke   But the missing person Denzel shot isn't the only missing person contributing to his trauma this is an irrelevant detail in the arc of the story….ok   Despite being an officer of the law and having a gun Malek becomes Leto's bitch digging all the holes in the world - cool bro.    So we get a 2 hour crime thriller with:   No character progression ☑️   A corrupt police force ☑️   The killers never caught ☑️    Dead girl gives Denzel a foot massage☑️   Rami and Denzel team up for quite literally no reason ☑️   Denzel accusing Jared Leto of having a boner = guilty ☑️   Rami Malek playing a cop who looks and speaks in more creepy fashion than Letos murderer-but-not-a-murderer character ☑️   Girl who was chased by the killer at the start for some reason takes note of Leto despite the fact she didn't see the fucker chasing her at the time.    She sees Jared, for the first time, in handcuffs and decides she needs a better look at him - *sigh* right.    And by the end - everything that happened in the movie becomes null, void and useless - why?    Becuase Albert Palm tree prime suspect is fucking dead.   Whether it was or wasn't him is now irrelevant - if it was he'll never pay and if it wasn't an innocent man's dead and Jimmys off the case anyway.    That's it. That's the conclusion of a 2 hour story    Creepy Albert for some reason has access to a plot of land - he convinces Malek, the police officer with a gun, to get into *his* car and then start digging up random bits of the land    He states that Deacon isn't welcome to join them yet he knows Deacons there, in Alberts time onscreen it's shown he's very aware of Deacons presence when following him - he knows Deacons a police officer whose going to probably notice his partners gone and so is the car he's been tailing all day.    Despite all of this Albert who is clearly not the killer, plans to kill Jimmy - the director who wanted to 'do something different' then has Jimmy smack Albert with a shovel which in typical fashion is enough to kill him instantly.    Nothing is discovered, no one is recovered and nothing really happens."

Joy leaves the party to commit suicide, this is represented by the everything bagel that is revealed to be a black hole (death) and why Joy asks her mother to “let her go.” Since we know Evelyn repeatedly told her daughter she was getting fat, it is assumed that she probably did say it again in the parking lot but that they probably didn't hug afterwards like Evelyn recalls. Joy most likely went home and poisoned herself with an everything bagel. It is the last 'real' memory Evelyn has of Joy, and it's also why the memory isn't portrayed in another dimension. After the death of their daughter, Waymond continues with the divorce, and Evelyn presumably loses the family business. The memories Evelyn has of Deidra are real, and she absolutely loved her but they are seen as happening in the hotdog dimension because the relationship happens after the events of the movie and while Evelyn's dementia is in a worse state. The movie probably takes place in a much older Evelyn's mind, and the ending we see is how she thinks the events actually took place. We can see one last glimpse into how Evelyn zones out (dementia) right before the closing scene."

They told you about an hour in that the wife faked it all to get her husband the death penalty and the movie just got better after that. Not only did she do all of that but she actually fakes a whole different crime to another guy and kills him just to get back to her husband.  There was a scene in the hospital where she called out the lead detective or officer for her being incompetent with how she handled the case. Usually in movies it'll be some kind of revenge thing or some way that the cop just HAS to get the truth. There was none of that. In the end there was no savior or magical evidence that arrested her.   They ended it with just truth and I felt that was one of the more realistic ways a movie has ended. I didn't see it coming at all and I actually was just waiting for something. A wire or a mistake. Unrelated but I watched Shutter Island and was much more impressed with the twist in Gone Girl compared to that. Movies always have to let the bad guy get caught. This was a pleasant surprise.

Great stuff  -Seeing Titane, with only a young couple, the young couple then left about a half an hour through it. And I got to watch a great movie all by myself, so I could laugh hysterically when she does a seductive dance in the firehouse  -Seeing Barbarian with a great crowd on opening Thursday night, and genuinely shocked at how much I loved it, considering marketing was pretty nill leading up to it.  -Seeing The Green Knight with a group of high people around my age, no one was disrespectful, everyone was just taking in everything and just having a crazy experience considering the content. They were genuinely into it, even though they didn't know what to think when it ended.  -Saw Thousand Years of Longing in an empty theater, wish I liked it more, but being all by myself and only paying $7 for a ticket is the best thing in the world"

The goofy happy ending is ridiculous whereas Clerks was more ambiguous. Jason Lee is still fun to watch in this film, but I found the main character (played by Jeremy London) very unlikable. Still some good scenes, but not near as good as I remember."

A problem I see in these films are that they don't offer solutions to these lonely men, rather they emphasise that there is no exit out of this crazy world and the protagonists of their respective stories continue to suffer and recieve no help for their struggle. Are there any films out there which are able to simultaniously tap into the minds of these lonely men, and also show them that there's a way out of the cycle of loneliness and depression? Lonely men are able to relate towards these characters, but the characters they relate to are given no way to escape their cycle of loneliness, and so these men are gonna start believing that there's no escape for them too. What I believe is needed is a story that can show these men who need desperate help that there's still hope to hold onto, and that this cycle of loneliness isn't forever."

        "body": "So if you don't know the 300 movies were originally going to spark a full anthology series taking place in different battles across history. Zach Snyder wanted to make a movie taking place in the American Revolution, but Rise of an Empire was so bad he canceled it. So I watched Filmento's take on Rise of an Empire and thought up the perfect idea for a 300-style American war movie. Looking at all the aspects of the other two to make it.   1. Strong character  What made 300 such a good movie was its leading character, Leonidas was the King of Sparta and an inspiration to all of Greece. The movie shows this by having him go through struggles and trials, we see his origins as a young boy who was always on the verge of death and we see how it made him a skilled warrior and aspiring leader. But Rise of an Empire doesn't have that, hell, I don't even remember the main character's name. He's just an Athenian hoplite who killed Xerxes's father and is fighting a fleet that is never given any importance.   This is something we can fix with the Revolutionary War movie, George Washington is already the perfect candidate for the movie. As American history portrays him, he was a Virginian farmer who got selected for the British Army and lead a group of Natives to attack a French fort, triggering the French and Indian War. Already we have a backstory that can be delivered in perfect Zach Snyder fashion. George Washington also had to go through obstacles and challenges, he wasn't a good general in his early time and had to work to be the best, when the nation founded the Articles of Confederation had no way of collecting taxes for the states which caused his men to starve. He and his army were going to collapse until a Mercenary came and helped train the men. Hell, we could even give him John Wick fighting styles to make his character better.   2.  Exaggerated world  The point of 300 was that it was propaganda told by an untrustworthy narrator who explained everything the same as any Greek man in the war would think during ancient times. The Persian army was mostly dudes and skilled warriors, but the movie showed dudes, giant animals, immortal demons, and even whatever the hell that big guy was. Rise of an Empire didn't have this, sure we had dudes in tighty whities killing fully clothed dudes, but that was it. The only cool element of that movie was those shark monsters that are only a dream sequence.   The American Revolution was full of propaganda portraying the British as killers shooting innocent people and Americans as freedom fighters. The British enlisted different types of men to help fight for their cause as well. These included Native American warriors, Hessian Mercenaries, and escaped slaves. Hessians were already seen as boogeyman-type figures by the Colonists so it wouldn't be hard to portray them the same way immortals are portrayed in the movies. They could be these weird green reptilian monsters that speak inhumanely or giant black knights on horseback chopping people's heads off. Natives obviously could be seen in a similar way.   We could even have creatures from Native American mythology and European lore fighting on both sides creating chaos. Maybe Washington needs the help of an Oneida Shaman who takes him on a drug trip like in a Far Cry game. There could be giant wolves ripping throats or Bigfoot even, that's a no-brainer.   Obviously, historical accuracy wouldn't be a problem here since when did the last two films focus on that?   I'm not saying this would be a good idea, but it at least makes a sequel worthy of 300's name, what are your suggestions?"

Assuming this is the case then Scrooged is a sequel to A Christmas Carol as it follows on, years later and skipping potential other stories, from the events in the book.   If it were a straight adaption the book wouldn't exist and the events would mirror the book moe closely such as being confined to nocturnal hours rather than having Frank Cross interrupted as he goes about his day.   &#x200B;  So what are your thoughts sequel or adaption and why?"

I know that Mattel wouldn't take such a huge risk with their most iconic brand, but I just can't see Ryan Gosling on the screen in a hyper realistic Barbie world and not assume that there isn't something hiding below the surface.  At this point I'm scared that I'll walk into the theater expecting a bait and switch but just end up sitting in a room filled with 10 year old girls and their moms who are unnerved by my presence for 2 hours.   But I'm just as worried that it may turn out to be the opposite. What are the chances that the Barbie movie changes my life and I have to live with that fact for the next 60 years?   I can't take it anymore I just can't tell I can't tell I don't know I don't know  The trailer that came out today started off with a Stanley Kubrick parody there's no way in hell that this movie isn't hiding something I refuse to believe it I refuse  there's no way they aren't gonna subvert expectations with this I just know it it's too suspicious there's no way this isn't a troll   it's too perfect and I just can't comprehend it being normaI know I know I know you're hiding something   PLEASE SOMEONE TELL ME WHAT IS THE BARBIE MOVIE?????

All of these were a great experience at the theater as well but my top 3 left me thinking about them for days and multiple viewings at the theater.   Everything Everywhere All at Once- The most creative, touching and crazy movie I've ever seen and really resonated with me. I still don't understand how they managed to make such a wild movie so easy to follow and understand. My new favorite film of all time.  Top Gun: Maverick- A true old school Hollywood blockbuster that demanded to be seen in IMAX and man it was INTENSE! Knowing how it was filmed in real jets and what the actors went through to make this film happen really added to the experience and made you feel as if you were inside the cockpit with them.  Avatar: The Way of Water- James Cameron is a mad lad. 13 years later he managed to pull off the same magic that Avatar (2009) brought to the big screen but did it much better imo. Visually mind blowing...I'm convinced that Weta FX is full of real wizards to be able to make this film a reality. I saw this in IMAX 3D opening night and wow the 3D is INCREDIBLE! Please see this in IMAX 3D if you can because it's the best way to watch it. The story is simple, yes, but it's very well done and will resonate with those who have a family. I was sad when I left the theater because it felt like I had went back to boring Earth. Tied for my number 1 favorite film of all time. Going to see it again with my family for Christmas!"

This one, Kids, was shown to us in high school (I think I was 14 or 15), or at least the first 30 minutes or so in conjunction with a subject about sex or drugs.... can't remember. After watching the whole thing over a decade and a half later, I am now convinced that that teacher was smoking pot because there is absolutely nothing of pedagogical use in this trash, and worse, it could have led many of us down a delinquent path.  &#x200B;  ***The story in short:***  In inner city NY, a boy named Telly is going around the neighbourhood deflowering virgins as a hobby, while in his downtime drinking, talking in the most raw disgusting way about girls possible, and causing trouble across the neighbourhood with his equally awful friends.  Plot Twist: Telly is HIV positive (he is likely unaware) and when one of his previous victims finds out after getting a positive test, she travels through the city to find him and let him know.  &#x200B;  **Why this movie is awful:**  I could just say everything but that would be cheap.  \\-Zero plot development by the end. You could just shut it off at 40 minutes and you wouldn't have missed anything, other than more showcase of how awful the characters are.  \\-Disgusting main characters. Not a single character has anything likeable about them. The way they act, the way they talk, is repellent from start to finish, and there never seems to be any consequence to anything, bolstering the nonchalant nihilism motivating the writers.  \\-The naturalistic storytelling is matched with a lack of any clear message other than: the world is going to hell, no one can do anything about it, so that's it. Given however the predicament the protagonist is in, we could at least have seen some come-uppance of some kind, but no.  \\-AIDS, dugs, alcohol abuse, race relations, homophobia, rape, teenage delinquancy.... all these subjects seem to be here to shock the US public and little else. There are plenty of triggers for the audience throughout the entire movie, but no clear message. The movie seems to be trolling the viewer, and little else.  \\-We see this serial triggering of reactions from several elements: -the sexual dialogue by Telly, then the boys, then intermixed with the dialogue by the girls, the fight scene in the park with the racial undertones (as the black guy is knocked out, brutalised and spat on), the verbal attack on the homosexual couple, robbing of an Asian store with verbal abuse to distract the owner, rape, the concept of HIV being spread to virgin girls.  This way beyond simple triggering by depicting decadent lives of inner city delinquency. It is a package to provoke the audience wherever possible. This is the bread and butter of this trashy movie.  &#x200B;  \\-Girls at 13 can be pretty naive, but I have trouble believing they are as naive as the main characters in the film are depicted.  The teenage girls of the movie are little more than dolls, on their way to be victims, and act as such.  &#x200B;  Basically fewer and fewer people will remember this movie and for good reason. It has nothing other than shock value, and the most vile dialogue you will ever hear in a movie.  I went into it with an open mind. The above is what I came out of it with. It is a shock fest with a nihilistic message and ultimately no larger statement to make.  I contrast this with Christiane F. – Wir Kinder vom Bahnhof Zoo which is the polar opposite of this, and with no less awful content, but with an actual message, based on an actual story.  &#x200B;  I rate: ***5 out of 100***  &#x200B;  EDIT: Several of the comments seem to claim I hated the movie because it wasn't a happy story or because it's subject matter may be disturbing, or there is some moral objection here. No. The issue is that these elements are all the movie has going for it, and ultimately does nothing with any of them. (The movie I compared it to above should however make clear that the content isn't the issue)  Despicable characters alone do not a great movie make. Edgy subject matter and shock value don't either. It seems to me that many believe the provocation and shocking depiction of the characters and juvenile life alone in and of themselves qualify the film as a form of naturalistic art. I do not. It is a necessary but not sufficient condition for it.  (Though one might wonder for those same people, if shock and disgusting subject matter is all that is needed, whether if the director himself drove over and unleashed a dump on their front porch, whether they might dissect the remains for objective value as it can't just be what it is at face value, surely)  For me, it's a void piece.  EDIT 2: I am reading all of the comments disagreeing with me. I respect those that take a different view and am trying to see where they are coming from, even though I feel quite secure in my judgement of the film.  EDIT 3: Many users have commented that this movie was not that exaggerated compared to their experience in similar areas and circumstances to what they grew up in. I respect that. However it does not completely detract from the point that the movie has little to say based on that experience, as I outlined above. The film is a movie, not a documentary, and shies away from making any larger statement beyond just a fictional depiction (albeit based on factual wider circumstances). I have been told at least 20 times I have missed the point of the movie, but the problem is that the point is not clear, or at least may only be visible to certain people, for those that hold a mirror to themselves and see something. Such being the case, I accept the limits to my own comprehension. However, from a general perspective I think the point is still muddled."

Scrooge (1970) is hard hitting, and a great musical. This movie has the best take on Stave Four that I have seen from any version.   Scrooged (1988) is a fun piece that did a job of applying the story to a modern setting. How many fingers does Mrs Claus have?  Lastly the Zemeckis directed motion capture version (2009) is criminally underrated. The animation complements the horror of the story in a way that live action can't really do. It makes me wish more version stuck with Dickens's depiction of the Ghost of Christmas Past being a candle.   Anyway, what do you all think? What are your favorite versions of this story?"

Lots of people don't want to sit for that long or are immediately turned off by the length 2. Costs! That's more time spent shooting, more CGI, more editing, etc. 3. The chief complaints of the movie are always: it was too long too slow could have used some editing 4. Longer doesn't mean better, editors exist for a reason  Some Examples:.  Avengers: Endgame 3:01.  The Batman 2:56.  Avatar: Way of Water 3:12.  Black Panther: Wakanda Forever 2:41.  Elvis 2:39.  Eternals 2:36.  No time to die 2:43.   That's just random examples of some of the highest grossing movies of the last couple years.  The impetus for this post is that my girlfriend didn't want to go see Avatar or Wakanda Forever because they were too long. We have the AMC movie pass, so it's not like it even costs her anything besides time. I've happily watched plenty of very long movies, many more than once, but I don't understand why studios greenlight such long scripts.   Side note: Artistically I totally understand the necessity for long movies, but most Blockbusters are hardly art. I would gladly have longer movies to avoid travesties like the studio cut of Justice League or Once Upon a Time in America,"

        "body": "Maybe this has already been said before but I'm drunk and was rewatching this movie now that it's on streaming, and I started to notice something about the significance of the two main character's animals. When I first watched this movie I figured the idea was the donkey represented Padraic because he was being stubborn but wasn't quite sure about how the dog would fit in so I let the theory go. But this time around I realized I had it backwards. The donkey represents *Colm* and the dog, *Padraic*. And I started to see the complexities of their dynamic explored in these two animals and how they're treated.  These two men have a very specific and not super conventional relationship at least compared to most western, modern day sensibilities. They live on a small island, it's hard to avoid one another let alone avoid anyone at all. They don't entirely make a great pair, like the bartender pointed out, but without time, enough boredom, and enough alcohol, any two people can become friends of some sort.  And yet despite that these two men truly need each other. They're both lonely, at the end of the day. We see that Padraic doesn't really have a whole lot of friends aside from Colm. He hangs out with Dominic but really only out of pity and because he's sad. When he's at the pub there isn't really anyone else for him to sit with, despite the rest of the village thinking he's a nice man. He's likable but there maybe isn't quite as much substance there, hence the dull comment by Colm.   It's similar to Colm's dog. Anyone can like a dog, but dogs are generally seen as not very smart. Though this is a border collie, which may be important specifically because of the fact that Colm doesn't have any sheep. A border collie *isn't* stupid, they're actually rather smart for a dog, and yet he's not ever used the way a border collie is meant to be used. He's simply around to keep Colm company.   Colm seems more popular on the surface but really most of his popularity has to do with his music. He's made a small name for himself making music to the point of attracting mainlanders to come and play with him, and 'the ladies love him' but seemingly only when he's playing music so they can sing with him. Almost any time Colm is not playing music, he's at home, smoking alone, save for the one scene at the beginning when he's getting a drink before Padraic comes in.   The donkey, conversely, explicitly has something that it does. Padraic makes a living off his farm animals, they have 'substance' so to speak, and yet they aren't just farm animals to him. He cares about the donkey beyond how a farmer might care for their donkey, even letting him into the house when his sister tells him not to. The donkey is Colm, not only because he's obviously stubborn but because perhaps Padraic is the only one on the island who cares about Colm *beyond what he can provide* - his music.  Colm likes Padraic for the comfort he provides, and maybe just simply for the entertainment, hence why he says he kind of likes him after he makes a scene the one night in the bar, but ultimately he also just doesn't want him to speak. He just wants Padraic to give him unconditional affection without him talking to him, and to entertain him from time to time, but he doesn't care about Padraic's needs, abilities, or wants, really. He's completely stuck in his own head.   We see he loves his dog for the same reasons he supposedly hates Padraic, but the dog doesn't speak. In fact his dog never whines, or even barks once in the whole movie. I think this is to represent the dichotomy of him liking Padraic when he's drunk, when he's maybe more able to look past the 'dullness', vs. having to deal with the real Padraic when they're sober or when he's buried in his despair and can't see the good in him or the reason he likes him. But he doesn't want to admit that, he thinks the only thing that defines him is his music, and that Padraic - and by extension comfort or self love - is holding him back. He pushes away Padraic because maybe he doesn't think he deserves that kind of love, or people who are nice, despite clearly still needing it as we see by the way he treats his dog. The contrast of how he treats Padraic vs how he treats his dog illustrates this. He likes what Padraic can give to him but he doesn't want to indulge him, because that would mean needing to be considerate of *his* feelings, not what he can provide him. We see this with the wagon scene. Colm's ultimatum didn't mean that he never wanted to spend any time with him, he is *specifically* asking him just to not speak to him anymore. When Padraic has been beaten by the policeman, Colm doesn't hesitate to scoop him up and take him on the wagon back home. Not only does this illustrate he still cares it shows how their relationship survives in silence. There's a possibility they would still have had some manner of relationship if Padraic never spoke, but the *moment* Padraic starts crying, once Colm has to confront Padraic having feelings and being his own person, he stops and gets off. He doesn't want to or maybe isn't able to deal with Padraick's feelings, only the closeness and warmth he provides him. It would also mean indulging with things that he's scared are wasting time, even though he likely still enjoyed doing them. He expects Padraic to be able to just put up with this absurd ultimatum, because he wants Padraic to be like his dog. Quiet. Obedient. But somehow still happy. He thinks he's stupider than he really is, so he expects it to be an easy ask because why would a dog care? A dog would just go off an find another person to pet him and play with. However in his stubbornness and depression, Colm doesn't realize that the *reason* Padraic is so happy is because of his relationship with Colm.  Colm accidentally killing the donkey illustrates this I think. The fact that it was an accident is a deliberate choice. This isn't a malicious character. He's sad, he's old, he's scared of death, but he doesn't wish any harm on Padraic, he just has a misguided idea of who he wants to be. He doesn't realize what he's doing to Padraic or how hard of an ask it is. He doesn't realize what his relationship means to Padraic because he doesn't really think much of him, he just uses him for the comfort. So the donkey accidentally choking on his fingers feels like it represents the way he didn't expect the ultimatum to have such an effect. For one, the donkey dying represents Colm's talents dying because he can no longer play his music. He knew this was a possible outcome of course but I don't think he really wanted it, and maybe he felt even if it does at least it might give him something to add to his legacy, or maybe deep down he wanted to see if people still wanted to be around him if he could no longer provide something for them. Secondly, it represents the final severance of their relationship. Colm is dead to Padraic, afterwards. And I don't think that was ever the intention. Again, I think in his fear, despair, and arrogance, Colm thought Padraic would be able to just adjust to them not being friends fine and it not hurt him, but he didn't realize just how much he meant to Padraic.   And yet the dog lives. Padraic isn't dead to him. Deep down Colm still likes Padraic. He just doesn't want to admit it, because to him he feels like that would mean he is okay with just enjoying life instead of doing something important that leaves a legacy. He isn't able to let himself do that. It's either be a great musician who's remembered by many or be a great friend who's remembered by few. There isn't room in his head for both those outcomes."

A lot of movies have extended editions or directors cuts that have very few changes like a extra joke or something. There are some that can change the pacing of the movies or an entirely different ending and  changes the viewers experience but get cut due to time restraints or other reasons. So what is your favorite director's cut/ extended version?   Me personally it's the Zack Snyder Justice League. The original theatre version was easily forgettable with little interesting scenes and dialogue but the recent Synder cut was a complete change introducing a better origin story for cyborg as his dad guided him on how to control his powers. Another favorite is the “Rouge Cut” from X-men Days of Future Past and Lord of the Rings. But what are yours"

But at the end of the day he was the king! It's hard to register how influential a figure like him was in his day.  I suppose I went in thinking this would be more like Walk the Line with Joaquin Phoenix. Maybe a little more pizzazz knowing a little bit of the director's work from the past. But for most of the film I wasn't sure what I was watching.  I have seen other comments on here saying it was made for the TikTok generation with how spastic the filming was. I feel as though the director made his style more of a character than Elvis himself. Butler's performance would have shined more brilliantly... or more accurately without the excessive editing.  I guess you can say larger than life figures like Elvis could use a style like Lurhmanns. But for me so much of the film was just cringy. It looked like it didn't have faith the modern audience would be interested and so it tried making it something more like a caricature of Elvis and not who he actually was.   I'm not sure how this film will hold up. But I can't help but think years from now. People will look back at the film to study the art direction of the director and less the subject matter. I think Elvis deserved better.  I guess I just wasn't prepared to see a hero of mine presented in such a way. Anyways, I guess I just needed a place to vent!"

The reason for that can be seen in Star Wars.  While Empire is certainly more action-packed, the first film was such a quantum leap in quality of space movies.  Its set and craft design was simply never seen before.  One could argue that Alien is also far and away better than Aliens.    Similarly Lost Ark is great as it introduces the universe.  But I wonder if Last Crusade measures up.  It doesn't really have any dead scenes.  We won't speak of the two other films that feature a sidekick.  They don't measure up.  But can it be said that Last Crusade is as good as, or even better than, the original?  EDIT:  I need to recognize Wrath of Khan is without a doubt a certain case of sequel > original.

Also why is every male character a pervert? Why does every female character lack personality?  Recently I watched Dumb & Dumber since it's a classic. I didn't hate it. There was some pretty good stuff in there, but the constant gross-out kind of made me roll my eyes a bit.   Then I watched Talladega Nights because I noticed it had positive reception and Will Ferrell is in it. I absolutely hated it. It's everything I can't stand about movies from this era, and I find it seriously overrated. I'm aware of the context of the film as well regarding NASCAR. It's just constant perverted shock value. I felt like I was watching a live action version of a bad modern Family Guy episode.  This isn't me being a puritan, I don't mind edgy humor. In fact, especially in today's time, I miss it, and I think we need it back (I disagree when people say Tropic Thunder and Blazing Saddles are dated). But it shouldn't be this incredibly juvenile. Gross out humor and perversion are such easy and cheap jokes that take little to no thought. It feels like a 13 year old wrote some of these scripts. They kind of age the film too imo.  Meanwhile, I find animated movies like Shrek 2, The Simpsons Movie, Emperor's New Groove, Madagascar 2, Kung Fu Panda, Ice Age, Bee Movie, Ratatouille, Toy Story, etc. to be far more timeless and hilarious in comparison. I get the sense that smart people who cared were writing these and TRYING, rather than having the comedians improvise scenes or cheapening things out. Usually the gross out in these films were incredibly minimal (there'd usually be like one joke and not several), and because they're forced to be family movies, the male characters aren't massive pervs. I even find a lot of the female characters in these movies more identifiable and interesting as well. I also find some, but very few, modern animated comedies like Wish Dragon and The Bob's Burgers Movie to be just as good.  I even find Beavis & Butthead: Do America, and South Park: Bigger Longer & Uncut to utilize the previous tropes I criticized better. In Beavis & Butthead: Do America, the well-thought out stupidity in every scenario overshadows the pervertedness of the protagonists (it also clearly establishes that not every guy in this world is gross. Beavis & Butthead are intentionally supposed to be the minority, and unnormal). And the South Park movie's shock, at the very least, is more nuanced with its satirical themes of censorship, and the characters have a broader charm.  Animated shows from this era, which have more diverse protagonists, are even better and funnier too!"

        "body": "While many critics have claimed this film is about cancel culture, that narrative is incredibly reductive to the broader themes of the film.  Lydia Tar is presented as an absolute power in the beginning of the movie, in complete control like a conductor who controls an orchestra. She speaks with an air of complete authority, confident and verbose, pulling from a million different references. When a naive but we'll meaning young conductor tries to push back she pounces on his apparent inexperience, using his mention of Varese as an opportunity to prove she knows more. In a brilliant oner that blends Tar's eloquent verbal barbs with the prowess of the direction of the scene. When this scene is shown later in the hatchet job form, the one take and her verbal performance are mangled, the self she was attempting to present obliterated.  We should talk about the self because that is one of the main things this film is about. The films opening narrative thrust is the anticipation of completing Mahler's fifth symphony. While there are many more popular composers within the classical canon, there are few as heavily mythologized as Mahler (probably Wagner, maybe Beethoven). It's hard to explain what exactly I mean, there is something so maximalist and dense about his music, much like Wagner's, that it instills for many a feeling akin to spirituality. This is helped by various factors such as the time Mahler lived in, the height of classical music's social power, and Mahler's own tragic life, which leads to many interpreting his works through the lens of his life, something Tar herself mentions. The main thing to get at though, is that the classical canon is already heavily mythologized, lines are drawn on retrospect to connect everything together in a linear path from Palestrina to Shostakovich. This canon starts to fall apart throughout the 20th century due to the more limited range of music exploding into a thousand styles of impressionist, expressionist, post romantic, serialist, nationalist, avant garde, modernist, post modernist, spectralist, etc. not to mention the popularusic that erupted at that time. Mahler epitomizes this very manufactured mythology, and not only as a composer but as a conductor. Up until Mahler's time the conductor was still not given nearly as much power as they would be after him, and to a degree were still mostly concerned with keeping rhythm, even Mahler's contemporary Richard Strauss, an esteemed conductor, had a fairly straightforward approach to the form. Something about Mahler's more expressive conducting became an inspiration for the idea of the conductor as a translator of the music for the audience.  Tar is aware of this.  When asked in a subtle way to justify her role, her importance, she goes on a long tangent that ends up approximating because I understand the music better, I hold the secrets that none else do and only I can deliver them effectively. This is her creating her own mythology. She is surrounded by people who have reinforced, and to whom she has reinforced, said mythology until she begins to believe it herself.  Towards the end when Bernstein talks about how music is how it makes you feel seems so far removed from her esoteric analysis, and this is not to say her analysis are not without value.That is what makes Tar interesting, like many famous artists who were horrible people, she is good at what she does, but the point is that she is too concerned with proving how good she is at what she does that she has lost sight of the reason she loved music in the first place by the time she reached her peak. The tragedy of this film is not her downfall, that was only the predictable results of hubris. No, the real tragedy was an artist who loved art, who become so sebsumed within her own ego that she began to believe that she was the art. It's ironic the one thing she struggled completely at was composition, the part of music requiring pure creation, not interpretation. She uses many lengthy sentences to describe why past music is so important, but I suspect, in part from the VHS of Lenny, the biggest reason is nostalgia and the power nostalgia music can create, and that is where her fixation lies. At one point I believe she refers to music as the closest experience to the divine or something to that effect. In that sense then, she has become a god to herself.  This is what jutified all the hypocritical and monstrous things she did, blacklisting Krista and trying to hide the evidence, using her power to gain sexual favors, regularly belittling those she viewed as beneath her, which by the start of the film seemed to be nearly everyone. Because she believed her own mythology she felt free to manipulate others because she was so close to the divine morality was inapplicable to her. However, it's worth noting this self mythologizing blinded her to the ways in which she was actually being manipulated simultaneously, such as by the cello player who drops her once she has what she wants, nor is she as aware of the way in which her transactional relationships require a transaction from her, leading to mistakes rooted in presumptuousness. However by the end of the film she is reduced to nothing, her self mythology obliterated, and in her humiliation she is forced to see herself unshrouded in the mists of ego. Her experience in the massage brothel forces her to confront how her relationships in exchange for favors have been in no different than choosing a girl from a fishbowl. Her being forced to play with a click track for a gaming convention is brutal in how it reduces her role to that of a visual metronome, unable to at all manipulate time which she talked so much about earlier in the film.  Now there's is one other big theme this all ties into. Tar is a critique of auteur theory. The film opens with the full credits, showing the full range of people who created it, not letting the audience leave at the end of the movie as they roll. In many ways auteur directors are quite similar to conductors, conductors are even often referred to as music directors. They orchestrate a large number of people with separate skills to one single goal, and this are similarly mythologized, but as many people through the years have pointed out, are rarely in direct control of every aspect of a film, and disproportionate credit towards them can and frequently does diminish the roles of the countless other artists and workers that create their own works wholly from their own skill. Similarly, conductors tend to be placed in the spotlight and paid disproportionate amounts of money, and a performance's quality is frequently mainly credited towards them.   Tar is a great conductor, the film makes that abundantly clear, but what it also makes, especially with the ending, is that the performance can and will go on without her. Though she is able to give many ideas to the musicians as a whole, the musicians ultimately are the ones who's skill are required to realize her ideas, they are the ones with the means of production. And like with any transactional relationships couched in a severe power dynamic, of that sort, she needs them to believe her mythology more than they need her to direct their capabilities."

Not quite at the heights of Shrek and Shrek 2 but it's easily third best and in that conversation. It delivers the madcap and irreverent energy we love from Shrek, plus gorgeous animation, inventive action and plenty of heart to boot.   The gags never stop coming, with many delightful riffs on fairy tales, nursery rhymes and other classic stories. John Mulaney as Little Jack Horner is having the most fun here, and the movie plays as if they worked around his improvising (a la Robin Williams in Aladdin). There is a riff on a Pinocchio character that is completely bizarre yet hysterically funny, not least because of the absolutely perfect voice acting decision.  Of course, the film's foundation is the Puss in Boots character. Puss remains a delightful and endlessly entertaining character, thanks to his exaggerated panache, Banderas' spirited delivery, and the hilarious contrast between bravado and adorable kitty cutesiness.   Just like the early Shrek movies, this has some very funny pop culture references. By this I mean that it's not lazily winking at other movies for cheap nostalgia, but adapting imagery to its fantasy setting in ways that are surprising and stylish.   I mean it when I say this is gorgeous, with a new visual language not seen in previous Shrek films. Like Into the Spiderverse and The Bad Guys, the film uses cel shaded models and has 2D textures and effects incorporated into the 3D environments. This creates a cartoonish look wherein characters are more expressive and the environments more dynamic. Elsewhere, during action sequences, characters will leap between frames, compressing space and time to create an exhilarating and swashbuckling pace. Above all else the direction is filled with stylish choices, my favourite being characters' expressions revealed in the reflections of swinging weapons.  Although the plot doesn't always unfold naturally alongside the character beats, all in all this is a rollicking good time with a fun script, loveable main character, and spectacular direction.   For me it's a 9/10 and I think it will emerge as many folks' best animated film of the year."

I've been thinking about how this doesn't use the conventional tropes as most movies, and I'm wondering what other films do something similar? David Lynch is almost known primarily for his singular language, but in particular Eraserhead just does it's own thing. Very little dialogue, very few characters, and the main supporting character is deliberately hideous to create distance between the two characters, but also between the viewer ad the baby.  Breaking the fourth wall is also an example of this. However, in Funny Games the antagonist does more than just break the fourth wall, he actively disrupts the timeline of the movie in a way that even usurps the traditional fourth wall breaking.  Can you suggest any other movies that don't  use the conventional language of cinema?"

        "body": "First of all, I'm not a fan of movie remakes. That being said, I usually do love horror remakes and in this article I'm going to talk about my top 5. I'm not making this a countdown to the best because for a couple of them I couldn't decide which was better. Instead I'll be listing them in the order they were released (the best one still ended up at the end, haha).  THE RING (2002)  Directed by Gore Verbinski and written by Ehren Kruger, The Ring, was based on the Japanese horror film by Hiroshi Takahashi and it ended up being a monster. Lead by, Naomi Watts, the cast included Martin Henderson, David Dorfman, Jane Alexander, and Brian Cox. From the opening moments it took us on a journey of terror that I rarely feel watching a movie. Seeing Samara crawl out of that well, then out of the television made me uncomfortable, not to mention the hidden Easter egg included on the DVD release where you could actually watch “the video” for yourself. I did, and at the time my home phone ringer sounded exactly like the one they played in the hidden feature. Talk about instantly regretting my decision. Watch a video and the phone rings, the voice on the other end tells you, you will die in seven days, and people did. Sifting through the clues was part of the fun of the movie, discovering every layer of the greater mystery that was The Ring. The film today has a 71% on Rotten Tomatoes, and grossed $249.3 million, not bad for a PG-13 horror release. If you haven't seen it, for whatever reason, you should. I can't recommend it enough.  THE TEXAS CHAINSAW MASSACRE (2003)  Directed by Marcus Nispel and Written by Scott Kosar, The Texas Chainsaw Massacre was based on the original of the same name from, Kim Henkel and Toby Hooper. This was one, at the time, that I was not looking forward to seeing. The original is a horror classic and number one on several lists of greatest horror movies of all time. The cast, lead by, Jessica Biel, and featuring, Johnathan Tucker, Erica Leerhsen, Mike Vogel, Eric Balfour, and R Lee Ermey, all turned in amazing performances. I was pleasantly surprised that I ended up liking this remake as much as I did, I put it right up there with the original. The gore was hard to watch but that was the point, the kills were fun and original, the ending was unexpected for the most part, spoiler alert, Leatherface loses an arm! All that being said the creepiest part of this movie is still the little boy. I can see him licking his teeth in my nightmares. The movie is fun and entertaining and is very worthy of a watch or two. The critics at the time however did NOT agree with me. The movie stands at 37% on Rotten Tomatoes, and grossed just $107.4 million at the box office.  THE HILLS HAVE EYES (2006)  Directed by Alexandre Aja from a script by Alexandre Aja and Gregory Levasseur, The Hills Have Eyes was a shot in the arm for a genre that had been lacking for a couple of years. Based on the original by the master of horror, Wes Craven, this remake broke a lot of rules. With a cast that included, Aaron Stanford, Kathleen Quinlan, Vanessa Shaw, Emilie de Ravin, Dan Byrd, Robert Joy, and Ted Levine, the majority of this horror fest took place in broad daylight. Yes, there were scenes at night when awful and terrible things happened but most of this film (including the amazing climax) all took place during the day. No one could hide in the shadows, we all knew exactly what the “hero” was facing because the “monsters” (a family horribly mutated by nuclear fallout) were lit by the sun in the middle of the desert! If you have yet to watch it, I do recommend it, it's an amazing horror ride. I will say there is more than one very uncomfortable scene so tread at your own risk. The film was panned by critics, holding only a 52% on Rotten Tomatoes and it didn't earn much money, only $70 million but it made up for it in video sales, garnering a pretty large cult following.  EVIL DEAD (2013)  Directed by Fede Alvarez and written by Fede Alvarez and Rodo Sayagues, the Evil Dead remake took the concept of the original and turned it up to eleven. Based on the original by Sam Raimi, a film that could have used the kind of money this one had, Fede took everything we liked about Sam's film to the next level. Sam Raimi and Bruce Campbell even believed in this re-imagining so much, they produced it themselves. The cast included, Jane Levy, Shiloh Fernandez, Lou Taylor Pucci, Jessica Lucas, and Elizabeth Blackmore and they made the unbelievable happenings of the flick seem like they were really happening. It was gross, it was scary, it was uncomfortable, it was even funny at times, this movie was everything that it needed to be. At this point it goes without saying (because it wouldn't be on my list if I didn't think you should watch it) but you really need to see this movie if you haven't. It's a fun trip that wastes no time getting right into the action. You won't be bored. This is another film with a low Rotten Tomatoes score, only 63% and it only pulled in $97.5 million but I'm telling you, pick a night and see for yourself.  ​IT (2017)  Directed by Andy Muschietti and written by Chase Palmer, Cary Fukunaga and Gary Dauberman, IT was worth the wait. If you've made it this far then you know I set it up by saying the best was last, and in my opinion, IT is definitely the top of this crop. Based more on the book by Stephen King (is that cheating my premise?) than it was the 90's mini series starring Tim Curry, this movie really had it all—scares, touching character moments and growth, terror, mystery—it's a great film let alone an amazing horror film. The cast was lead by Jaeden Liebherher as Bill Denbrough and Bill Skarsgard as the inter-dimensional monster known as Pennywise the clown and both of them do an amazing job respectfully. This movie has some of the most disturbing imagery I've seen on screen and there are certain parts I think of almost daily. If you haven't watched it yet then you really need to make that happen, and make sure you can follow it up with Chapter 2 because it's one long story spanning the years in Derry Maine. The critics and basically everyone else agree with me on this one, it has a solid 86% on Rotten Tomatoes and made a whopping $701.8 million worldwide, setting pretty as the highest grossing horror movie of all time.  So that's it, my top 5 horror remakes, let me know if you agree or disagree, if I made a mistake or somehow overlooked something you think should be here. These are some of my favorite horror films and I think if you haven't seen one or any of them…you need to fix that.  Twitter/Instagram | CrockettForReal"

It could be a very disturbing topic of cannibalism, it could be the genre of the road-movie, with characters constantly being on the move. I often felt like I am watching something staged, even surrealistic and at times almost grotesque. It didn't feel real, in spite of all of the intended realism, and, hence, left me cold. The shocking factor didn't work too somehow. It looked like a disturbing fairytale to me. What are your thoughts about Luca's most recent movie?   P.S. Taylor Russell is really talented.

        "body": "The Middle Earth movies are my favourite media series: I like all the entries, and across all six of them (no, The Rings of Power doesn't count) I feel there's the best unity across entries, being that all of them were made - uniquely - by the same writer/director and the same creative team.  That being said, I always embark on a rewatching of the cycle a little wary: the first film in the order of the narrative, *The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey,* is in fact my least favourite. So, now that it just turned a decade old, I think its time to square off with this film, why I like it, what about it I don't like and how it stands within the cycle as a whole.  I think its possibly the most visually rapturous of the six films: Andrew Lesnie's high-definition cinematography is crystal-clear and pin-sharp, and Jackson in his second venture to Middle Earth is willing to let takes hold longer (a 90-second oner in two different scales took two days to film). The result is that Middle Earth is on fine display: from New Zealand's verdant and vertiginous landscapes to Dan Hennah's meticulous sets of Dale, Erebor, Hobbiton and so forth: For all the complaints of CGI, the constructed environments are spacious and lavish. The movie belies scale at every turn, like David Lean's old adage about movie opera - it even has a praghiera scene - the deeply stirring Misty Mountains ensemble - that would not have been out of place on the Parisian stage in the 1850s!  At the same time, I think the issue is the rate in which the environments that make this dazzling tableaux pass by, which is too slow. The film has a deterimental pacing issue: its not so much the length of the setup which, at 44 minutes, is actually quite short. Rather, its the fact that once the company is on the road...the quest almost immediately stalls for the sake of a flashback to the Battle of Moria - which is very important to the psyche of one of our main characters, and to the story as the film sets-it up - and to a cutaway to Rhosgobel (again, very important going forward) and to an episodic adventure involving three Trolls, none of which gets us any closer to Erebor and the Dragon.  Now, many first entries have pacing issues because they need to get the piece off of the ground: Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone basically had no conflict until a good 90 minutes in, which is longer than here. The first Season of The Rings of Power show was excruciatingly slow. The issue here, however, is that it clashes with what author Ian Nathan calls the bawdry tone of the film.  And this is really the core of the film, and the source of both its strength and weaknesses: An Unexpected Journey is the satyr-play of the Middle Earth cycle. It seems, says Ian, that Jackson is sending himself off when the Dwarves irreverently trash his beloved Bag-End or temper with the pomposity of his finely-cast Elves. Even the Dwarves themselves are the image of the satyr chorus: hairy, stount, virile and indignant.  I personally think its an inspired choice: the comedic tone could only work for the very beginning of the cycle, and it fits the idea that we are here revisiting Middle Earth at a time of relative peace, indeed on the eve of Sauron's ressurgence. This way, there's room for the later entries - both in The Hobbit but also The Lord of the Rings itself - to get consistently darker, which they indeed do.  At the same time, it does heighten the pacing problem. So much so that (even though I watch the film in 2D) I put an intermission into the movie at the same point that the 3D had it: right after Azog is revealed on Weathertop. Its a fine place to pause and, that way, returning from intermission the White Council sequence feels like a more naturally-placed exposition dump rather than stopping the movie dead in its tracks.  The segment of the movie that follows is thankfully the film at its strongest: a lot of it has to do with the dizzying rate in which the setpieces are dolled-out: Rivendell, rain all but pelting the audience's faces in the high pass, torch-fires licking at their faces in the rickety Goblintown, rustling pine-trees in their ears in the Forest Ledge and alpine air of the New Zealand skies, in one of the series' most sublimely romantic moments. Of particular note, too, is a standout scene with Gollum, which Jackson wisely and boldly chose NOT to intercut with the Goblintown scenes.  But, as per usual, the true core to the success of the film's second part is in its character interactions: they become more concentrated and therefore more focused. As much as the film is about Bilbo (Martin Freeman) finding his place among the company, its about the Dwarves - those lovable satyrs - accepting Bilbo into their ranks. There is a pair of confrontations - Bilbo and Bofur, followed by Bilbo and Thorin - cleverly constructed to mirror each other, which serve to underline this basic thrust of the movie very artfully and which all these years later I still find deeply moving and affecting. 7/10"

They get across the initial conflict, give an idea of where the escalation starts and sets-up both the protag- and antagonists in a satisfying way. No more questions, your honour.   This new trailer feels twice as long, shows some of the same footage, and adds a TON of unnecessary plotlines, story beats, jump scares, and late-stage footage to show the viewers a recap of the whole thing.

I mean this dude is chatty, friendly, and pulls of a successful con and disappears off the face of the Earth. It'd make a thrilling story. One perspective could be from DB Cooper and Tina Mucklow, the flight attendant who had most contact with him. Cooper calms down several irritated passengers, has friendly conversations with Mucklow and even jokes with her a few times. He cooperates with the flight crew and harms no-one (except the bank, of course). There could be another perspective from the FBI agents tasked with retrieving the money, delivering it to the plane and then searching for him afterwards.

The actual story of this is really sad when you think about it. It wouldn't have taken a ton of work to turn this into a tragedy like Death of a Salesman or something. Seeing a guy who's never anything but kind to anyone get repeatedly kicked in the proverbial ass is heartbreaking, and even though it takes its time to set all this up, Capra and Stewart really create an immensely sympathetic protagonist.  And at the end when he's finally repaid and can enjoy his life with his family, it's so immensely satisfying. Even though less than half of it is actually set at Christmas, the themes of generosity and kindness are so powerful that it really is a great holiday film.  Also Mr. Potter is public enemy number one. The man literally steals thousands of dollars from a struggling family just to have George arrested for shits and giggles. Even Scrooge wasn't that blatantly malicious."

I feel like TGM, Shawshank & then The Mist but man, do they have some great climaxes. The Mist is still one of my favorite horror films, Thomas Jane was so good in that, possibly my favorite role of his even though I really liked him in The Punisher (2004) & Deep Blue Sea (1999).

In Ralph Breaks the Internet the villain was a creepily insecure Ralph who misunderstood friendship.  In Frozen II the villain was someone who kicked the bucket decades prior and the protagonists are just dealing with the fallout (technically no misunderstanding).  In Raya and the Last Dragon the villain was a misunderstood brainwashed friend of the protag who apparently doesn't know what's right from wrong at 18.  In Encanto the villain is a misunderstood family member who realizes their mistake and makes up for it in thr course of 5 minutes.  In Strange World the villains are laughable squid like wusses and pink pieces of shit who were all just revealed to be fucking misunderstood.  What the fuck happened to Disney's great villains of yore who were both memorable and intimidating? Would Disney today even greenlight a villain like Claude Frollo?

So, bringing Aliens into the picture made it bad for most people...even though the aliens were worshipped as gods. Still technically biblical.  And people also complain about how the movie looks. Like why is the movie so bright and with a white tint? It's because they wanted to copy the way they made movies in that era, which is pretty clever actually, but no one liked it.     And everyone hates Shia Lebouf and I have no idea why. I did read about that he copied an already existing script word for word and that's why people hate him. I guess you can hate him as a person, but as an actor and the movies that he has been in have been good films. I Robot, Constantine, the Transformers trilogy, Fury, I thought were all pretty good. And him starring in these movies did not ruin the films, unlike how most people think that that is the case.  Everyone's excuses are pretty dumb. I think they just hate just because they want to. Just like what happened before the Morbius movie came out. Everyone made memes of it because they knew that it would fail. The movie wasn't that bad, but everyone memed the shit out of it.

So, did the military just not test whether the anti-matter cannon could destroy entire planets? Because it seems like if they have a planet-killing weapon that the idea of destroy entire planets is not too far of a stretch of a use for the weapon… So, if the military wanted to drive the aliens to extinction, why not, just like, simply destroy their planet by pressing a single button? Why the convoluted hassle of gas lighting a child in military camp and trick him into playing video games.  If anything, they put the entire mission at risk by letting a child sacrifice thousands of personnel without as much as knowing the scope of the mission or the weapon's capabilities…  It is a great movie.

So I share my opinion with you to see if it's all in my head or if you think like me.  I've always been bored with the parts of a film that talk about intense love stories, and above all I've always been bored with films that revolve completely around a love story.  Personally I am part of that new generation where romantic relationships are non-existent and sex is a completely hedonistic pleasure. I'm not complaining, but I also think that intense relationships could be a good experience as well and it's a shame that I can't understand them.  In this film, however, I can appreciate the relationship between the two, because unlike other films, the love story between the two characters is not put there to give meaning to the plot, but it is the film that gives meaning to the relationship, making it the key to everything. Basically Donnie initially lived to the accident just to get to know the girl and then as the relationship progressed the esotericism in the film became more and more significant up to the final part where they had sex and the world ended for Donnie by making him kill the real frank, in such a way as to make possible all that happened and return to the parallel world where he dies.  Virtually all the esotericism of the film is connected to the love story making it actually exciting because it is full of meaning, instead of as is usually done where it is the love story that makes the whole film exciting just because it should be significant in itself since we are human and we like these things trivially.  Ultimately I love this movie because it managed to get me excited about a love story, somehow making it more important than it is.  What do you think?"

He had a troubled relationship with his parents from what I'm gathering.   I also think he was terrified of getting too close to people. He usually only spent a week or two with people and then left. Probably goes back to the issues with his parents. But I think what he needed and what he was actually searching for was deep connection with others. It's a shame he was too scared to invest in that. I think he even realized that himself right before he died. Remember one of the last things he wrote was “happiness is only real when shared.” It's a shame he realized it too late.  Remember the old man at the end, Mr. Francis? Chris had a golden opportunity to form a meaningful, lifelong connection that they both desperately needed but he was very hesitant. I wonder, how would things have turned out if he'd survived Alaska and spent more time with Mr. Frances after and maybe met a woman to settle down with.  Another interesting angle is the fact that his death is the main thing that has brought relevancy to his story. His sister said that if he were still alive he probably wouldn't understand what all the fuss was about. He was simply on a journey to find happiness and fulfillment for himself.  What do you think Chris was searching for? How do you think his life might have turned out if he'd survived Alaska? Open to any feedback!"

It's also up there for one of the most tragic movies I've ever seen. So many scenes looking back that are absolutely heartbreaking.  The saddest scene for me is easily the scene where Michael hugs fredo at their mothers wake. Michael enters and fredo glances up with such the saddest look on his face, like a dog with his tail between his legs who knows his owner is upset with him. Then Michael goes closer to embrace fredo, and fredo grabs Michael as tight as he can. Just watching fredo embrace his brother so tightly, thinking he has a brother again, and knowing what happens later, is heartbreaking. It brings me to tears just to watch.   Then you have Michael with the coldest look in his eyes, like there's nothing behind them. He glances at his associate, who both know what will happen to fredo after the wake. Then it cuts to fredos arms grabbing Michael, and he grabs tighter and tighter. He has so much love for his brother and it's like his life is complete again. Meanwhile Michael feels nothing.  There's so much going on in such a short scene, so much emotion. And the score being played is immaculate. Easily my favorite and most heartbreaking scene in the whole movie.   What's your favorite part of this movie? I could talk about it for hours."

When Marvel first started to roll out the idea of an extended universe (I literally had no idea who the Avengers were until someone mentioned it after the 1st Captain America), I started to learn more about the larger universe.   One of the constant comments I've heard about why DCEU has failed miserably while Marvel has flourished is that Marvel is connected to the real world and real world issues (NYC gets demolished, X-Men is an allegory to the civil rights movement, etc.). Beyond the artistic development of making it lighter and all that other jazz, the DCEU seems to have a very big disadvantage in that their superheroes are simply too powerful it seems.   As opposed to Spiderman, the X-Men, Iron Man, and Captain America who start off with very grounded villains before they go off into space, it seems as though DC heroes really have no capacity for that. Other than Batman, all of them are essentially gods and so the only true villain can be other gods - which of course feels like a reinforcement that Batman would be the most popular since it's the most grounded in its story.   So for those who are more deeply knowledgeable about the DC comics, what does a successful DCEU look like? What does DC have to do to keep the story grounded to make them more relatable while their most popular and/or notable heroes are gods amongst men who need gods to defeat them?"

Now, the movie isn't something very special, but it does happen to have some excellent acting. For fans of Jessica Chastain & Eddie, this features some of their best work. I couldn't believe The Good Nurse sold me the easily likable Eddie Redmayne as a creepy, suspicious looking dude.  Aside from the performances, the drama was alright. The stakes were established very early on and the only question that remained from the start was the 'why' of the murders.  It the disappointment of some, we don't exactly get the answer to the 'why' of it but it is based on a true story and the culprit in real life never gave the reason as well.  But as the movie ended, I felt the why isn't always necessary. Some people just want to watch the world burn or their intentions/thinking are so complex that the answers are always too complicated to distill into a few minutes in a movie.  The Good Nurse is an above average movie carried hard by the performances & nice direction."

A machete gets stuck in the post of the tent at some point and the crew are killed or go missing.  The movie then shifts to modern day and people end up in this area maybe to go camping or exploring and come across the tent and the equipment with the machete still stuck in the post and they question it but soon they start to get picked off. They are getting hunted by something similar to the predator.

There were in total four novels and fifty six short stories - characters such as Irene Adler only make 1 major appearance and 3 mentions, Mycroft Holmes 2 major appearances, 2 minor appearances and James Moriarty as iconic as he is only 1 (!) major appearance, 5 mentions - on top of that, before 2009 his last appearance pre 2009 was in 1990; during this time 12 Sherlock Holmes productions were made  Not to mention the ideas such as Irene Adler working together with James Moriarty, Sherlock being a sociopathic weirdo with fighting skills or him magically surviving The Reichenbach Fall"

Robocop, The Matrix, Star Trek, Blade Runner, Sunshine, and so on.  Occasionally you get some horror elements like Alien, Life, Virus, or Invasion of the Body Snatchers.  But sci-fi could - and does - blend easily with other genres.  Just not as often, and I think that's unfortunate.  We could have more romance movies like Her or Your Name.  We could have more comedies like Weird Science or Multiplicity.  We could have more heart-warming dramas like Bicentennial Man or A.I.  We could have more sports movies like Real Steel.  Obviously sci-fi *does* move into these genres, but I would like to see it done more so that sci-fi doesn't immediately bring to mind action and fighting.  Edit:. Thank you all for the movie recs, but I am not looking for movies to watch, and I have seen almost everything mentioned so far.  I was interested in people's thoughts on the tendency for sci-fi to lean toward the serious and the dramatic."

The conversation goes much the same, but then after Toby's family leaves, both men realize there's nothing left to do but get on with it:  Toby watched the car leave the drive, the setting sun fading in and out of his peripheral vision as the movement of the pumpjack briefly obscured it, then let it shine through again. He closed his eyes, letting the light dance orange and red through the lashes. He slowly reached down, clicking off the shotgun's safety.  Slowly turning back toward Marcus, he sighed. “Well…”  He felt the warmth seeping from his chest before he even registered the two shots still echoing across the flat.  “Shit.”  Marcus stood there, a look of concern spreading across his face. “I expected you'd turn the other direction. I missed my spot a little bit. Sorry bout that.”  Toby grunted in pain and let out a bitter laugh. “Ain't that just my luck.” He fell to a knee, then flat on his back in the grass, looking at the sky through tears.  “Fuck. This hurts.”  “I know son. Breathe through it. Won't be too long.”  Marcus pulled out his cell phone and  started to dial 911.  “What you gonna tell 'em?” Toby gurgled.  “What happened,” Marcus choked out, pulling a tobacco pipe as the dispatcher answered. He gave the address, packed and lit the pipe. “They'll deal with me, I don't intend to fight it.”  Marcus looked down at the younger man dying in the grass of his childhood home.  “Your boys'll be fine. I'll see to it nobody messes with 'em out here.”  “Thanks,” Toby said, “they're better off anyway. Never….thought I was gonna get away with this. Never meant for people to -“  “I know, son,” Marcus said, lightly touching Toby's arm as he struggled to draw final breath. “I know.”  Final shot pans out over the horizon as we see two police cars and an ambulance racing toward the house with lights and sirens blaring. Credits roll."

So the only things you should criticize or praise about a movie that matters is both the cinematic and storytelling aspects of it.  I'm not saying you can't have a personal opinion about movies. I'm just saying don't let personal biases and agendas cloud your judgement when the discussion comes up about which movie is best/better. My favourite movies are Catch Me If You Can (Cuz I imagine myself as the protagonist) and Warrior (cuz of my brother and I's relationship). But I can easily recognize Shawshank Redemption and Fight Club as the objectively superior ones. And I think more people should differentiate their critical and personal opinions about entertainment products and come with 2 lists.   It's probably why my most critically acclaimed movie era is the late 80s, 90s and early 00s. Think about Shawshank Redemption, Forrest Gump, Fight Club, Se7en, Scarface, Silence Of The Lambs, The Green Mile and American Psycho among others. They're movies that weren't too modern that they fall under the trope of prioritizing spectacle or... ugh.. politics.. over story and characters but they also aren't too old fashioned that people who watch them fall under the trope of the nostalgia dilemma. I get that you can have a weak spot for a movie because of your life situation at the time of watching them (like with me and Warrior) or your hype at the time when it came out due to it breaking new grounds with special effects and cinematography and that's all very fair. But it sucks that these technically bias views on pieces of art reduces or outright debunks the credibility of the simply better executed movies premises because critical acclaim isn't placed where it's due.  Anyways this was my rant. I would love to hear some of your thoughts on it."

Even the author of the book that had to write the script for this movie hated all of the changes.        I grew up watching both movies and loved them both, and at the time I didn't know that there was a book. When I read the book when I turned 12, I realized that they got the title wrong for the first movie, but not the second one. Then when reading the book, I realized that the second movie was exactly like the book. And afterwards I wondered why the first movie failed so much. And what is weird is that everyone I talked to about the second movie, they thought that I was crazy that I thought it was good. Apparently, everyone loves the first movie and hates the second one. Did no one read the book? Did anyone know that there was a book? I don't entirely hate the first movie. Comparing it to the book and then back to the second movie...it is pretty bad, but as a fantasy movie for its time, I guess its ok.      So why does this movie get so much hate, but everyone loves Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory?

When they meet it's not like this big oh my god I love her moment, it's just a little brief friendly moment between coworkers.

It involves a chase-down at the airport and a big confession of love in a public setting, all things I'd normally laugh at but my eyes were glued to the TV because I just bought into this fake relationship so much.

        "body": "If you have any suggestions for a movie that didn't appear on the list, I would really appreciate it, I haven't had anything interesting to watch for a while.  &#x200B;  **- Favorite -**  &#x200B;  **1.** **starship troopers**  my favorite movie, bugs from space, a satire on military commercials, also includes some romance, the special effects didn't get too old, and some good advice for life.  2. **Ginga Eiyuu Densetsu Gaiden: Ougon no Tsubasa  // Ginga Eiyuu Densetsu: Arata Naru Tatakai no Overture**  a saga of movies that work very well as a start to see the anime, I will always mention that it is like seeing the foundation trilogy taken to an anime adaptation, a world of cinematographic fiction focused on the raw aspect of war and politics well worked with a broad perspective (I did not include the second film because I feel that it does not contribute something important).  3. **inuyashiki**  The best live action anime I've seen, highly recommended for its special effects and the classic cliché of here and the villain, but now it's an old man and a high school boy, it's very good but the manga surpasses it if Speaking of narrative, too I must mention that it has one of the fights I enjoy the most in movies along with some martial arts.  4. **The mist 2007**  excellent movie if you are looking for something from lovecraft, different perspectives of each character falling into fear, the special effects feel very satisfying and the best thing about the movie >!that ending was very sad to see!<.  **blood glacier**  About the remake, it's almost the same but I feel that this one is faster with its beginning, a dog to worry about, a romance that develops slowly, good creature design and the scenes put you in a lot of tension, in general a 9.8 Note ending due to certain special effects (please watch it in German which is the original language, the screams are very good).  **Hadashi no Gen**  Possibly the movie where the grave of the fireflies was inspired seems to me much darker than the one created by Ghibli but it was much more serious and that's why I enjoyed it more, because I felt the impact of the fast situations.  **The Man Behind the Sun**  I don't have much to say, it's a movie/documentary about the horrors of a World War II Japanese experiment.  &#x200B;  **- Action -**  1. **The Raid 1 & 2**  Very good action, probably the best I've seen.  **Drive**  action but more style and italian and raw, this is a great option.  **Oldboy**  A classic and what a rare movie.  **Redline**  the speed is impressive and that animation is explosive, really if you are looking for a frenetic animation this is a great option, I love the trailer.  **undisputed 2, 3 & 4**  If you are looking for something more of the boxing and mixed martial arts style, this is a great saga.  **Matrix**  another classic from the same period and also that green tone mixed with black, I love its gothic style.  **Aliens: The return**  shooting party!, I liked it a little more than the first one.  &#x200B;  **- Horror -**  &#x200B;  1. **Rammbock berlin undead**  I love this movie, that romance that unfolds and its ending impacted me a lot, in general I like apocalypse movies made by Germans, if you have any suggestions similar to this movie I would really appreciate it.  2. **Splinter 2008**  It has a good hook and especially those special effects, the truth felt very good, if you want some drama and good terror it is an excellent movie if you are looking for something more based on terror and not so much on action.  **You are next**  My favorite thriller, it has a lot of massacre and I don't have anything else to say either.  **Cold fish**  If you are looking for a more Japanese style, this is the one I recommend the most, I don't want to say much so you don't lose the surprise, but it's a crazy movie.  **The Thaw 2009**  The effects of this film continue to amaze me, I think they are the best I've ever seen, although The Mist was more interesting. I only recommend this if you've already seen the rest of the list that touches on the theme of horror in the style of the thing.  **Train to Busan**  A classic if you are looking for zombies, I would say the best, except that they did the live action at the Seoul station, it is much superior in narrative but sadly it was a very bad animation.  **Screamers 1995**  killer robots hiding among humans for a surprise attack.  **The horder 2009**  It feels more immersive due to its more realistic tone in American gang-style conversation, sadly the action is a bit poor compared to its dialogue.  **what we become**  trapped in their houses by the restrictions of the military, a lot of suspense very good, it feels like a thread that is always on the verge of breaking, a total recommendation if you are looking for something dramatic, but it has a small problem, I feel like it is missing something of action or to show more horror.  **Survival of the dead**  If you're looking for more of a military perspective, this is a great option. I think they achieved their goal well by the way they acted and the strategies used.  **The Wailing**  Wonderful movie, again the Asians making masterpieces, I can only say that the tension that this movie gives is good because almost at no time is it tension of persecution but of suspicions, it focuses a lot on rituals so for lovers of portelgeist this is it That is a great recommendation from me.  **Cloverfield**  The only handheld movie that was worth seeing for me, what a good movie that constant tension and when the monster comes out it was something spectacular like never before, seriously if you haven't seen it yet you should see it, it's excellent although the beginning is slow.  **Apocalypse disaster L.A**  If you want something within a city, this captures that feeling quite well, but there is a problem, it is that the special effects are bad and they hardly show any places, it shows that they did it in about 4 very closed places without the opportunity to record in the street But for the rest, if we talk about narrative and acting, it's pretty good, nothing spectacular, but it's passable.  **Seoul Station**  very, very bad animation, it's not the worst either since it has good work in the shadows and everything happens at night which helps to enjoy it, in general I recommend it because it has one of my favorite narratives in movies.  &#x200B;  **- others -**  &#x200B;  **1.** **Groundhog Day**  My favorite comedy and romance, he repeats the day over and over again becoming an omniscient god, and I especially liked the message that the movie leaves, it makes me smile.  2. **Donnie darko**  It is a film that had a great impact on me because of the decision made by the protagonist, it made me cry inside.  3. **Montage 2013**  a good detective movie, redemption and above all revenge but with a touch less of action and more of the relationship of life, I put this in particular here because it is my mother's favorite, I will only say how bad it is it feels long  Pontypool 2008  If you are looking for a suspense movie where everything happens on the radio, this is excellent and >!especially that ending so strange and funny at the same time I loved it!<.  **The Butterfly Effect**  classic and the firecracker scene hit me hard, that still hits me to this day in my mind before I go to sleep.  **kiseijû part 1**  Another great live action that I highly recommend if you feel like all live action sucks, this is a great option to see that you can do very good things that don't focus on comedy.  **Signs**  It is already a classic that everyone should know, quite dramatic and with great scenes that stay in the memory, but I feel that something is missing.  **A day**  the day repeats itself and he must save his daughter, quite dramatic but I feel that the plot in the end fell short and lacked polishing.  **museum**  Good movie about a detective and a serial killer.  **The Happening  2008**  I don't have much to say, it's fine but I don't like the relationship of the main characters at all, I feel that it becomes somewhat uncomfortable.  **Valhalla rising**  The Voyage of a Viking is the one I enjoy the most of the Viking-style movies, it has almost no narrative and is especially focused on silence and long walks and deep gazes, in a very barbaric style.  **Black death**  If you prefer something more European medieval style and not so Viking, this is my recommendation. A witches and knights film with a dark but realistic tone, it is not for everyone.  **delicatessen**  The weirdest movie I've ever seen but without losing its charm, I recommend it. It doesn't sound like a song made into a movie.  **When Nietzsche Wept**  You are looking for philosophy, this is my personal recommendation, I haven't seen many on philosophy, really, or rather I didn't find a good one, it doesn't satisfy my desire for philosophy, but it's passable and entertaining, the only bad thing is that it has very strange scenes which can be uncomfortable to watch with a lot of people.  **20th century boys part 2**  great villain, very good villain, I adore the scenes of this villain, that's all I can say about this movie, the rest is passable but the villain is the best of this movie and also of the manga honestly.  **9 2009**  This rather dark animated film marked my childhood, hidden among the children's films, this film clearly for adults with a lot to say about life.  **Poultrygeist**  If you want a movie that is the king of disgust, this is a classic that goes from looking for the record to the most disgusting of the cinema, and it succeeds, but that does not mean that it stops being entertaining and hilarious.  &#x200B;  **-honorific mention -**  &#x200B;  **Night of the creeps**  I didn't like the movie at all but what a great ending, it made me want to know what was there, what it was, I never imagined that I wanted a continuation of a movie that I didn't like hahaha."

        "body": "​Very few things I've watched over the years have had enough of an impact that I can say they “changed me” but Candyman from 1992 is one of those movies. Yes, it absolutely scared the hell out of me but it also made me a lifelong fan of all things horror. Books, movies, comics, if it leans horror I'm in, let's do it. If you watched the horror films I've consumed back to back it would take you literally years to finish the binge, it's that serious of a problem. Maybe it's more of a condition.  I was young, eight years old, when I first watched Candyman and the effects were almost instant, I say almost because for nearly a week I couldn't go to the bathroom if I was the only one awake. I couldn't walk past the bathroom mirror to get to the toilet if I didn't know there was someone who could potentially rescue me, or at least distract the monster while I got away. I was an only child so I was a bit selfish. You have to remember though, at this point in my life the scariest movie I had come in contact with was probably, Who Framed Roger Rabbit, and let's face it, that movie was also scary as hell.  I didn't get to see Candyman when it first came out—I grew up in a small town and the nearest theater was a couple of hours away—but we did have a Blockbuster Video, and we did, just about every weekend, take advantage of the (five movies, five nights, five dollars) deal that they offered. Going to the video store to pick out movies was a huge part of my childhood, some of my favorite memories are tied to that place. I learned a lot about myself by finding things I loved, and even things I absolutely hated, at a very young age. I've talked a lot about art before, art can teach you a lot about yourself if you're willing to listen.  So why did Candyman scare the hell out of me and how did that make me fall in love with horror? Well, one thing at a time. It scared the hell out of me for the obvious reasons, Tony Todd was a monster straight out my nightmares. The grimy coat, the meat hook constantly dripping blood, even his damn voice. If I hear that voice to this day I'll shudder. It probably didn't hurt that the summer before I watched Candyman I found out I was allergic to bees when I got stung on my eyelid and had to be rushed to the hospital. Then there was Virginia Madsen just selling the hell out of every scene she was in. When she was confident I felt confident. When she was scared I was terrified. She did an amazing job.  Bernard Rose wrote and directed the movie, it was top tier in my opinion from front to back. Of course it wasn't until years later when I was older and deep into my horror obsession that I found out all of this is Clive Barker's fault, the movie is based on his short story called, The Forbidden, an excellent read on its own. Candyman only went on to make about $25.8 million in the US on a budget of $30 million, but international and video sales kept it from being a bust.  For the second part of the question, how did it make me fall in love with horror, well, I didn't know movies could make me feel things like that so strongly. I was scared to death even though I knew it wasn't real, it made me believe those things were actually happening. It made me anxious. It made me generally worried for the people Tony Todd was after. I love all film genres but others fail to make me react with as many emotions as horror in such a short period of time. I think it's chasing that high, horror for me is like riding a roller coaster, you know it's safe (or hope it is) but you do it anyway for that adrenaline rush. I fell in love with the genre for that reason, I can get that feeling without ever having to leave my house and be around other humans, it's a beautiful thing.  By now I think I've made it pretty clear how I feel about horror and in my opinion there still hasn't been a movie to live up to Candyman (1992). It's pure terror wrapped in a neat 99 minute package that makes you feel all the feels. A perfect film and the perfect place to start for anyone who wants to have a reason to not look in the mirror for a while, as if I needed another.  Twitter/Instagram | CrockettForReal"

That kind of sent me down a rabbit hole - I've known all the lore around the tension and differences between the Stephen King book and the Stanley Kubrick movie, but have never read the book myself.  So I read it, and then immediately read Doctor Sleep as well.    A quick summation of my thoughts on both the films and books:   The Shining is a great book, faulty book to film adaptation, and a Masterpiece film.   Doctor Sleep is a really great book, largely faithful book to film adaptation, good movie, AND a successful sequel to the 1980 film.    That last part I think is the most interesting - given the distinction between the King book and the  Kubrick movie, I think the greatest feat of Doctor Sleep as a film that it seems to function well as a sequel to both without very many issues, IMO.    TL; DR: The Shining/Doctor Sleep films and books provide a fascinating study of the process of book to film adaptation.    Curious to hear others thoughts, as well as likes/dislikes within the books and films."

        "body": "Despite its underperformance at the box office (in large part due to the poor timing of release & lack of adequate advertising by the studio, and controversies surrounding one of it's leads), Spielberg's West Side Story is one of the best films I've seen in years and I feel that it surpasses the 1961 version in every way. While you could argue that it did receive an adequate amount of attention as it received numerous awards and nominations, it appears to me that the majority of the movie-going public has not yet seen the film.  With this reimagining, I feel Spielberg brings his magic touch of telling a story on a massive scale while also making it deeply personal. Not only is the story presented in a way that is moving and endearing, but it's cast is incredible and the cinematography and lighting are phenomenal. Spielberg's version of circa 1957-58 New York City is almost magical in the sense that it's the New York that may have never actually existed but one that exists in our collective cultural mindset. Additionally, I have a great appreciation for the modifications made to this film from its source material, whether the order and context of songs having been reorganized, the dance and fight choreography feeling more 'real,' the casting of actual Latin American and Hispanic actors, and the expansion of and flushing out of certain characters, such as Anybody's (also enjoyed the changing of Doc to Valentina as not only a way to include Rita Moreno but also as a way to create a new character and explore new themes). While I think West Side Story is a pretty timeless story that holds up well no matter how it's presented, their's something special about this film - I'm not a massive musical theater or movie- musical fan by any means, but something about this one just really stuck with me!  What are your thoughts? Do you think West Side Story didn't get the credit it deserved? Do you think it will become more popular or culturally significant with time? I've never created a conversation/open dialogue thread on Reddit like this so I'm really interested to hear what people have to say!"

They came out in the early 2000s but they hold up against a much improved (production value wise) action industry of the modern day.   Besides their excellent use of shakey cam (which apon rewatch felt a little overexaggerated perhaps with my perception affected by its later overuse) and genral trend setting, the pacing is well done its unbelievable. Never am i bored, between car chases, peak fight choreography, and intriguing dialog.  However, the thing that really stood out to me most on rewatch was the sound design. The sound track is exceptional. But the moments without any music are probably the best. The fights feel so crunchy from the sounds. And the guns feel so... i cant find the word. The sound plays a huge factor in how these hold up.  What do you think? Product of their time or timeless action classics?"

        "body": "As many people continue to use and rely on Rotten Tomatoes to get a sense of how good a movie is and to often decide whether a movie is worth seeing or not, I think it's important to remind people that the Rotten Tomato score is not calculated as probably most people assume it is. Let's get into it:  Most people perceive it as a movie that has a 99% rating on RT means that the movie is reviewed as outstanding with a score of 9.9 on 10 or 99 on 100 for example. But it actually doesn't mean this at all.   Likewise, people often assume as RT critic rating of 50% as being on fairly poorly rated movie with a score of 5 on 10 or 50 on 100, whereas again, this is completely inaccurate.   I score of 99% means that 99% of the reviews were positive reviews. The reviews all could all have said things along the line of “a fairly good movie..” and it would be treated as a positive review. This doesn't discriminate between a review saying that the movie was fairly good and a review saying that it was the best movie of the century. Both are treated as just a positive review. So a 99% rating on RT in no way means the movie was outstanding. In fact, 99% of the reviewers could have given it a score of 7/10 and it the RT rating would be 99%.   The same applies for a movie with a 50% rating. 50% of the reviewers might have said that the movie is the best piece of work of all time, and 50% of the reviewers saying it was a fairly poor movie. If 50% of reviewers gave the movie a 10 on 10 score and the other 50% gave the the movie a 5 on 10 score, then the average scoring would be 7.5 on 10 and actually better than the movie that had a 99% on RT."

And I want to clarify that these aren't bad guys that happen to be English or portrayed by English actors. Our heroes are fighting the British Empire itself, and the baddies are an extension of that.  Similarly, American movies that take place in different time periods face similar foes. Revolutionary War movies also face off against the British Empire. WWII movies face off against Nazis. Cold War era movies face off against Russians/Soviets.  But what are some movies where Americans are the bad guys?  Edit: Lot of comments mentioning films that feature American protagonists who do morally questionable things. I was more asking about films where some other nationality are the heroes and the Americans are the bad guy, antagonist, stock characters.  "

Upon the moment of their death, the suit consumes its current host entirely. Upon being put on by the next unsuspecting victim, the parasite permanently binds to the new host, takes them over, and endows them with the power of Santa. This enables and perpetuates Christmas and its associated magic. The suit does this without consideration for the host. Once put on, the host's fate is sealed.  The suit is so powerful that it creates and sustains every aspect of the Christmas magic we see. It's possible that the suit can even create life. Were the elves living the in North Pole before the very first Santa, or did the suit create them for its purposes? Flying reindeer, same thing. Did the suit force the elves to build Santa's workshop in the middle of a frozen tundra? It's possible that the entire North Pole is a manifestation of over a millennium of work by the suit.  Going further, without the suit, there is no Santa. And without Santa, there is no Christmas. However, in the brief period between consuming the deceased Santahost and Tim Allen putting the suit on, Christmas does not cease to exist. This means that the suit doesn't necessarily need a host to sustain it's magical power, it simply needs them to move. Therefore being the source of all Christmas magic, it's reasonable to believe that if the SantaSuit was ever successfully destroyed (if that's even possible) then Christmas would cease to exist.  And finally, every Santahost is doomed to the same fate - eventual total consumption by the suit upon their moment of death. Which poses serious spiritual considerations. When the dead Santahost is consumed, is their soul also consumed by the suit? Devoured? Spirited away?  And the suit has been doing this for over 1,200 years (Judy the elf's age). How many victims has the suit claimed? Is that how it sustains its power? Does it grow in strength with each meal?  And what is the suit's purpose? What does it want and where did it come from? Without answers, this is the only logical conclusion."

Here Wills character just exudes the fact “He doesn't want to be here” you can feel adrenaline coursing through his body and that he doesn't s betraying every better instinct to go in. And you can feel him pushing through all of that because he has to retrieve the dog. Period.   We do not get enough heroes conveying that they are ANSOLUTELY terrified but have a thing they need to do regardless of all of that. To be that's the epitomy of heroism.  Ellen Ripley in ALIENS was another excellent example of this at the as she goes to retrieve Newt. I think Weaver even said to James Cameron during filming when they were picking out weapons she said “You know I hate gun.” And he replied “Thats exactly why you're perfect for this”"

Jaws in particular works so successfully due to it's music, the fact that this was Spielberg's breakout success just makes me wonder how the film would have landed without it's iconic score. And granted, Williams had already produced several soundtracks prior to working on Jaws, so maybe they just brought out the best in one another and it's truly hard to separate which component benefited more from their collaboration. Like Danny Elfman and Tim Burton or in the sports world Joe Montana and Jerry Rice. Just thought it was an interesting conversation worth having."

It is Peter's brother, who is living in Paris, that is paying for the McCalilister family to fly out there.  Kevin's Mom explains it to Harry (dressed as a cop), in the opening scene.  > My husband's brother transferred to Paris last summer and both of his kids are still going to school here, and I guess he missed the whole family.  He's giving us all this trip to Paris for the holidays, so we can be together.   Now, in Home Alone 2, it does appear that Kevin's parents are the ones who pay for the family to fly down to Florida.  Uncle Frank mentions it when scolding Kevin:     > Don't wreck my trip.  Your dad's paying good money for it.

There's a real gold mine of oddball arthouse cinema from that time period, including films from greats such as Tarkovsky, Bergman, Kubrick, Malick, Jodorowsky, Pasolini, etc. But there's also a lot of smaller features by lesser known directors.

Yes he realizes how terrible he was for nearly raping her as well as how bad of an influence his friends were on him. But, still, just because you realize what you do is wrong and apologize doesn't mean people have to forgive you. And I think attempted rape is a pretty unforgivable action!  It almost felt like they had a sadder ending but the test audience didn't like it or they rewrote it before it was ever filmed because they thought audiences wouldn't like it. Still I think the movie should've ended with Stephanie not letting Tony into her house and then he walks away, rejected, wondering what he's going to do with his life next. I mean it literally begins with him walking why not end it with that as well?"

Death, cannot be cheated however and follows them, killing them all one by one in the order they would have died in.   There's movie after movie where a similar thing happens. Premonition, avoiding/cheating death, and death chasing them.

He wakes up, saves a bunch of people from this, and death comes for them in gruesome ways. They realise if deaths order is cheated or there's a death in the place of someone's, then it skips you. So by the end of the movie they think they're safe. Until they board a flight to france. First time seeing this my jaw absolutely dropped. They see Alex from FD1, freaking out, people getting off. Think nothing of it. Until the plane takes off. He puts his headphones on and hears the same same song from the start of the movie. Cuts his thumb like the start of the movie.

Even weirder is that I actually watched and liked Passengers, I thought it was a cool plot with an interesting premise, but mostly just that the writing failed to live up to the expectation so the execution was off.

But, there's something that bothers me. It has been a long time since I last saw the original Disney film (I am aware this film does not acknowledge it), and an even longer period of time since I read the original book. Indeed, I am not sure I have ever really read it, it may have just been an abridged version for kids.  Either way, though, does this movie not omit a ton from the book? Does it not alter its message?  For example. I believe there was a scene of Pinocchio being hanged. I don't recall it being featured in the film.  The book's message was a warning to young kids that they must not disobey their elders. In this movie, Pinocchio never does anything wrong. The only time he disobeys his Papa is when he goes with Il Conte Volpe, but he does not do that out of malice of ill will. How is that consistent with the tone of the book, which was a warning not to misbehave?   Please don't be rude, I am, quite simply, curious if anybody else has noticed it, and whether I might be wrong."

And how come after the bombs, everything went against Snow?( I know he mentioned it [the whole Coin set the bombs and it was filmed], but hasnt he done worse things and still retained power? Except for the rebels of course) - So, Gale knew about the bombs all along?, Was Gale aware of Coin's plan all this while? What if the bomb killed both of them? - Why was Katniss allowed to go home? - Do the games continue after this? Or did peace eventually start to reign? - ^^ Did the rebellion stop? Do the districts now live in harmony? Or there is no peace in Ba Sing Se?  I just honestly thought since Snow was the bad guy, killing him and taking down the Capitol will result in the end of the games and finally peace in all the districts"

Goldeneye is fantastic to me mostly because of its excellent pacing.  The slower parts aren't super long or drawn out, they're actually interesting and not overly sefl-indulgent (like the newer Craig movies).  The plotline is interesting but also simple enough to follow, and the cast isn't explaining the story to us.  Basically, it FEELS like a bond movie.  Its over the top, pithy, witty, has great car chases and shooting scenes, captures and escapes, huge explosions and tons of close calls.  Its kinda goofy like the older ones, but also pretty edgy and gritty.  To me its the perfect Bond movie.  To give context, my next favourites include Skyfall, The Man with the Golden Gun and TWINE....oh and I also enjoyed both Timothy Dalton Bond movies, and I wish he'd made 1 or 2 more.  He was the first 'gritty' Bond.  least favourite/ worst Bond is also a Brosnan (Die another Day)  there's some bad aspects in old Connery / Moore movies but at least they weren't try-hards like with DaD...  &#x200B;  Actually someone else suggested this, whats you're favourite bond movie per each actor?"

However, a number of horror movies seem to fit this mold, including The Cabin in the Woods (pure comedy into horror-comedy) or The Evil Dead II.  Any other movies that masterfully handle what should be a jarring transition? In the realm of horror movies, are there any examples of romantic comedies that turn into horror? I was struck by what Jordan Peele said about how comedy and horror often hit the same sort of beats and hinge on successfully flipping expectations in order to be effectively funny/scary, which is why they blend so well together."

Let's be honest, this isn't a controversial opinion or a hard case to make and probably has little pushback but I think the first Pixar movie still hasn't been topped in all these years by any studio.   The animation for its time was groundbreaking and seeing it around release was an unforgettable experience. I had seen The Lion King the previous year and that looked ancient in comparison. But that isn't the reason why Toy Story is the greatest animated movie of all time.   The story, memorable characters (Rex with his inferiority complex and non-confrontational nature, Buzz's Space Ranger obliviousness, Woody's jealousy at a new toy possibly replacing him and acting out, Mr. Potato Head's surliness, Slinky's loyalty etc.), emotional resonance, voice cast, animation, music, humor that appeals to all ages and the timeless nature of it. Some of the most memorable dialogue and one of the best buddy duos on screen ever. Other movies have many of these qualities as well, but Toy Story does it the best, in my opinion.  Every second literally counts (81 minutes) and there is no wasted motion. It is fast, explosive, perfectly written, funny, tense, full of character and takes a lot of risks with the premise and focusing on non-human characters and delivers on everything it promises.  The sequels were excellent (especially 2 and 3) but I don't think you can enjoy them as much unless you've seen the first because it depends on those original characters being established.

Just for the discussion, let's call the Omega the universe in which the Evelyn from the prelude (everything before the Part I - Everything title) lives.     So, what I get is that the Omega timeline is the one in which the fanny pack fight happens, in which Bagel Deirdre (verse jumped into Omega Deirdre) leaps at the staircase, and where Omega Waymond gets stabbed with the glass shard by Evelyn.     Also, I understand that Omega Evelyn is the Evelyn version that is the only Evelyn mind we follow in the movie (always verse jumped into each universe's Evelyn) - except, perhaps, during the flashbacks - it is blind singer Evelyn's mind who was into blind singer Evelyn's body when she pierced her own eyes.      I also get that the reconciliation scene between Evelyn and Joy near the end of Everything is not happening in the Omega universe. It is happening in one of the new year party universes.     But whose minds are the ones of Evelyn and Joy in that scene? I guess they are Omega Evelyn (who was the one Evelyn who evolved to become universally aware like Jobu Tupaku), and Alpha Joy (aka Jobu). Because that scene serves as the step for Jobu's spiritual pacification which led to her extending her hand out of the bagel or, in other words, reaching out to be saved.     But if that's the case, they are not mother and daughter, right?     On the other hand, when they verse jump they get the memories, experiences, skills and emotions from their versions they accessed. So it could be seen as if they are not only accessing their other selves, but that they are melding with them (well, what are our minds if not the set of our memories, experiences, skills and emotions?). So, in light of that, can we conclude that it doesn't matter if it was Alpha Evelyn or Omega Evelyn the one at the end, they were all one?     And the final scene at the non-destroyed IRS building... I understand that it is a universe other than Omega, right? And we are looking at Alpha Joy and Omega Evelyn at the end too, right?"

If your reason is nostalgia, ID with characters or situation, outstanding acting, etc. that is fine. I just want to hear reasons as well as answers!  P.S. I'm new to this sub, so if others have asked this question I apologize. Just let me know in the comments! Please be kind to others"

The whole reason Kevin's parents forget him is because they're in a rush in the morning due to their alarm not going off, caused by a storm that cuts off all power and phone lines.   They're not able to phone him from Paris to check on him because of the phone line issue. So how does Kevin manage to ring Little Nero's for his cheese pizza?"

        "body": "Just watched a bronx tale for the first time and I couldn't help but think something towards the end of the movie, did Lorenzo use to be the Mafia? Alot of things in the movie point me to that conclusion. His wife seemed to be accepting of him being involved in their racket, Lorenzo was extremely adamant about trying to keep C away from them almost like he knew from experience what happens when you involve yourself with them, sonny offering Lorenzo work with them as though he knew he could trust him, Sonnys tolerance for Lorenzo despite the Mafia's reputation for ruthlessness towards anyone that crosses them and the way Lorenzo and sonny communicated came off as two old friends talking as opposed to them treating each other like strangers.  At the end of the movie when Lorenzo was standing in front of sonny's casket with C I actually expected him to open up to C and confess to having a history with sonny but decided to go straight after he was born. It felt kind of disappointing that nothing like that happened because it would have really put alot of the movie in perspective. Anyone else who's seen the movie pick up on that?"

Is it one of those stories that's supposed to leave you hanging and guessing?   From the moment the swat team are after him and he calls his lawyer up and confesses - to when his lawyer thinks he was just joking and makes a remark about how Patrick Bateman would be too much of a coward to do those things. So is Patrick Bateman even Patrick Bateman or is his lawyer just getting smart with him?! Then his lawyer tells him he couldn't possibly have killed Paul Owen anyway because he'd only had dinner with him in London just a few days before that. Yet Bateman had been indulging in a killing spree in Owens apartment all along? He had even visited the apartment to clean up the mess he'd left only to find a real estate agent there and the apartment looking all spick and span.   And then what's with the “this is not an exit” sign at the end when he's sitting with his cronies in the club?   Whew. I do love a good twist in a story but this one has always sprained my brain."
