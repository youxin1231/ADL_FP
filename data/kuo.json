I know the Wikipedia page has an inflation adjusted list (which bumps Avtar down to #2 in favor of Gone With The Wind).  But this still assumes that movie ticket prices have matched exactly with inflation (which may or may not be true), and doesn't take into account the recent rise of premium experiences like IMAX, 3D, Dolby, Screen X etc which are higher than standard ticket prices.  So it would seem that the best way to determine the success of a movie is to ask how many tickets were sold for this movie?  The question is, do we have the data to answer that question?"

As much as Steven Spielberg would be the obvious choice of director I wouldn't mind David Fincher taking a whip at it and to top it having the author (Art Spielgman) be the consultant for it all.   Anyway it was just a random though, what film adaptions would you like to see with your personal dream team?"

        "body": "**BACKGROUND AND INITIAL THOUGHTS**  I just rented Clerks 3 on YouTube and I am glad I did. I have been a long time fan of Kevin Smith, more recently more of an apologist of his latter work. I can recognize his films of the last decade have been controversial and more miss than hit. Though I don't let that detract from the great work the man has brought to us. He seems to be in a phase where he is more self serving with fanfare and inside jokes than producing empathetic and relatable storytelling he was known for.  All that being said, I have been excited for the prospect of a Clerks 3 for YEARS (honestly after the credits rolled on the second). I know Smith has rewrote it many times, with original actors signing on and then back off, putting it in a limbo. So I was definitely glad when he finally said Clerks 3 was written and about to officially begin Pre-Production. Time has passed and we were given our first trailer and I was a bit more hesitant on the quality, seems to reflect more of his current work than his past, but I love the series and was still excited to give it a go.  **REVIEW**  I am now in a post-Clerks 3 work and I can happily say the ride has been worth it. You can tell Smith wanted to covey the maturity he has gone through, especially after his heart attack, and portray that accurately with his characters. The acting with every one is a bit meh, especially Randal's performance, but I was able to overlook it. It kinda felt like a low production play which I think provided much of its charm in the long run. Spoiler here - >!I wasn't a big fan of what they did with Rosario Dawson's character in the beginning. But I think it paid off in the end. I just wish they could've done something a bit different with her character.!<  I laughed a lot. I cried a bit. Then I laughed some more. It is a beautiful full circle film that closes the Clerks storyline in a appropriate and succinct manner. Spoiler here - >!when Randal shows Dante the first cut of the movie. And it jumps to the movie theater where Dante is watching Clerks 1. I was blubbering like a baby. You could feel this is coming straight from Kevin Smith in his vulnerable moments during his own heart attack. !<  I would rate each film as such: Clerks 1 - 9/10. Clerks 2 - 8/10. Clerks 3 - 7/10. Clerks 3 is weakest of the trilogy, but it also has some great strengths, particularly during the final act of the movie.  **CONCLUSION**  I would highly recommend the movie to the fans of Clerks, it's a must. To classic Smith fans, it's also a must. Tons of cameos and callbacks to other films in the universe. For average movie goers, it depends on your affinity to the series and director as of late. You might find more misses than hits, but I think most people can agree it was a decent send off."

I watched some making of... videos on youtube about famous animated movies and it seemed that the roles are not so defined as in live action movies, the creative process involves the whole crew and it's so cool!

I really can't stand the dialogue from the duo of Stephen McFeely and Christopher Markus in particular. Especially because it really ruins what are otherwise awesome movies.  I also just watched The Gray Man and couldn't help but think how the dialogue completely sank what could have been a pretty solid movie.  If you think of a writer with a similar style to Tarantino, Crowe, or the Coens, please comment a few of their movies too!  Edit:  even though he only has a few movies under his belt, I think a hidden gem is Ben Affleck. I really liked the dialogue in Goodwill Hunting, Gone Baby Gone, and The Town.

KoH director's cut completely changes the storyline and motivations for Eva Green's character as well as give a much more rounded and robust character arc for our hero.  T2's extended edition truly goes beyond the action/sci-fi veneer and gives us a much more heartfelt story about what it truly means to be human. The dichotomy between the machine that acts more human and parental than the actual human parent. The arcs for both Sarah Connor and the Terminator are dramatically changed for the better with much needed nuance.  Sound off!"

Another great example of what i just described is Top Gun: Maverick, which does practically the same thing. Gripping and brisk first two acts, and suddenly a third act that makes everything that much better.  So with these movies as an example in mind, what's a movie that has an exceptional first and second act, only for the third to wrap it up perfectly making it an amazing viewing experience?

Social commentary on rural life, racism and misogyny that isn't forced and comes in a very natural way.  Subtile details that are shown rather than told.  Gorgeous cinematography.   Action, yes, it has gun fights, it's actually wild.   Heartwarming moments that made me cry a river.

Eight Crazy Nights, on the other hand, focused too much on tugging on the heartstrings whenever it tried to do so that, when a fart joke or whatever suddenly popped up, it felt out of place.

Neeson can't do this forever; who's the next solid, liked, sort of thrillery actor who should pivot to making entertaining schlock? Or is that era coming to an end?  The actor shouldn't be much older than 50; there's only so much that can be done when an actor surpasses sixty. Russell Crowe is now too old, I think.  I nominate Aaron Paul; has the likeability, can use another win after minor roles here and there and the canceled West World. Still in his forties, but he's getting there - better start youngish."

But at least they somewhat look alike because the leading male roles are played by people who look nothing alike. Not a huge thing… I just feel this kind of movie almost needs that type of casting for it to flow and make sense. 2) I don't remember it being this cringey?! Maybe it's because I was younger the first time I watched it. Or maybe it's the acting? I can't tell. James Marsden is great and always is but, idk. I read the book and honestly loved the plot so not sure why it was cringey on screen.  That's it. Really I came here to say the eye color thing really annoyed me.

        "body": "Greetings! Recently I watched Miracle on 34th Street (1947) and it struck me how much my perspective has changed since I used to watch this movie as a kid. Two major aspects of this movie really stuck out to me while watching as an adult that I just totally accepted as normal as a kid.  First, Mr. Gailey as a protagonist... I used to really like this character and just assumed that he was a 100% good person that just wanted to spread love and joy and all the other intangibles. However, I see him now as kind of slimey. The fact that he openly admits to being nice to Susan to try and pursue a relationship with Mrs. Walker is kind of off-putting (not to mention he takes Susan to the Zoo without Ms. Walker even knowing about it, but the house maid so knew so I guess it's ok), but what really annoys me is how Mr. Gailey takes Susan to see Santa after Mrs. Walker explicitly told him she doesn't want Susan to be influenced by ideas that she sees as fantasy. To me, it would be the equivalent of a parent raising their kids to be athiest, and then someone comes along and takes their kids to church without getting the consent of the parent first. Mr. Gailey basically walks into Susan and Doris' lives and tries to enforce his world view onto them.   The other aspect of the movie that doesn't sit right is when Kris Kringle hits Mr. Sawyer with the cane. As a kid, it felt good to see this prick, Sawyer, get his comeuppance, but as an adult, I realize Kris Kringle not only lost the argument by getting physical first but he also validated part of Saywers concern that he was apt to become violent. Granted, it was for a different reason, but ultimately Kris did become violent first and then the movie glosses over that while still expecting you to feel sympathy for Kringle. If Kringle had just went to Mr. Macy originally like he said he was going to do without getting violent he wouldn't even have ended up in Bellvue and there wouldn't have been a commitment hearing in the first place.   So yeah, I still love this movie, still makes me laugh and smile but I have to put myself back in my childhood state of mind and turn off my cynical critic side."

I prefer slower Kaiju films like Cloverfield or Shin Godzilla, because it emphasizes that God-like power some of those monsters possess.  Any Kaiju movies you guys recommend?"

The 40 odd minutes after the heist are among the most forgettable moments in the history of heist films. We go from super exciting to very dull to exciting again in the last 10 minutes   - characters are rather poorly written. Affleck goes from leader/calm/ super planner/ conservative to plan sabotaging/ willing to kill anyone the moment he sees all the cash. The “best pilot” succumbs to the pressure of flying an overloaded helicopter in a second. Isaac probably was the only somewhat consistent character that we know something about   - Things just fall in place. “I know a guy” and everyone is super trustworthy.

The first act perfectly set up the conflict and all the characters.  I found the second act continued the character progression very well which gave you the feeling that these people could be real but they were still all interesting and unique. I also thougt that the antagonist (the bandits) of the film where showed in a very good way helping us realise why the villagers are so afraid of them. It also gave us a view of the life of a farmer during this time period and explored the cast sytem that was in place i japan during this time period.  This was all finnished in what was possibly the best final act in any movie ever. The action set pieces were fantastic and every plot line was tied up beautifully. And then the final shot of the four graves was probably the best final shot ever but to film.  I am very happy I was abel to experience this movie for the first time in the cinema it was one of my best movie experiences ever."

        "body": "A 3 minute live-action horror film called Fiona, based on the character from Shrek, released on YouTube last month.  The film starts with a knight leading up to the top of the tower where Fiona stands. Thinking he's her true love, she tries to kiss him, but is interrupted when she notices the sun setting down. In an unsettling fashion, she begins to quickly transform into her ogre form. We get a quick glimpse of her face, and it's a much more deformed and horrifying appearance compared to the original film. Her voice becomes more masculine and frightening. When the knight attempts to flea, you can hear her cry KISS ME! YOU HAVE TO KISS ME! KISS ME MY SWEET PRINCE. It almost sounds like a cry for help. Suddenly the knight trips on a leftover corpse in the hall, and while pausing, he hears the same uncanny voice shout COME BACK!. He continues to pause, when suddenly the green monster begins to run toward his direction. Rather than getting up to run again, he accepts his fate, but is surprised to hear chewing sounds from her finishing off the leftover corpse. He slightly tilts, as if he is attempting to escape, but the ogre immediately notices. The film ends with her grunting toward the camera, and the credits begin to play with a slow cover of All-star playing in the background.  I personally don't really like the concept of turning children's media into horror films. I don't mind making things edgier, like the Samurai Jack revival, but making a full on horror film, to me, is the equivalent of a traumatizing porn parody. I know that makes me kind of sound like a puritan, but it's just my opinion. I'm not demanding a ban or anything on this type of content.  I also think the quality of most of these films have been absolute garbage. The Banana Splits Movie is just a cheap FNAF rip off with horrible acting (I really hate the title too because it implies that this isn't a parody, but rather the same universe as the original series). The Mean One, which is a Grinch parody film, also has garbage acting and just a frustratingly bad script. And while it hasn't been released yet, Winnie The Pooh: Blood & Honey also looks very cheap and has a story that doesn't sound very fleshed out at all. I'm sure the upcoming Bambi won't be anything special either.  Before I saw this Fiona film, I thought the trend of horror adaptations based on children's media was just going to become the next generation of bad creepypastas. It's kind of funny looking back on those now, and the campiness of how scared everyone was of them during a time when it was new, and the internet couldn't easily contact creators of shows/movies to debunk this nonsense like they can now. Now we have a couple of REAL horror films and... in my opinion, they're not scary or interesting.  Fiona however is absolutely the best one in my opinion. For starters, unlike the previous horror movies that try to create new generic stories, this film is based off of an actual fan theory involving the character. Before this film released, people speculated that the knights in the original Shrek movie were actually remains that Fiona ate. Think about it. She was locked up in the tower, probably doesn't have access to food, and she's probably traumatized and struggling to balance her new ogre-self, and her human self. Think of it kind of like The Hulk (ironic I know. Green people). Ogres also traditionally eat humans in fairy tales. People have speculated that this is the real reason why Fiona's father locked her in the tower. To protect her from other people. The dragon was just a warning to prevent people from entering. As for The Fairy Godmother (who worked with her father) and Prince Charming, many people believe that the Godmother is secretly the witch who casted the spell on Fiona or was at least involved with that situation (she literally owns a factory where she invents magic and potions), and she ensured that Charming would have been immune to Fiona's actions. Shrek didn't eat humans because he just wanted to be left alone. He was BORN an ogre so he likely found an alternative for eating, such as cooking swamp animals, and didn't commit to any violent tendencies toward actual people. But to Fiona, it's just an affliction that takes over her every night. She can't control it. Shrek, a FULL-ON, probably helped her control it when he came into her life.  I know to some of y'all this sounds dumb, but people have fun writing these theories.  This short film is such a twisted and neat display of that idea. The people who made this were clearly fans of the source material if they were willing to create a movie based on this. The creators consider this movie, based on Shrek lore. I felt so bad for Fiona because she's clearly desperate to be normal again and would kiss any man who steps near her just to go back to having a normal non-isolated where she can no longer hurt others. Again, this is not my thing personally, but I can see why to some, it's cool to see a horror adaptation of this idea. The only problem I have with this film is that it doesn't make much sense as to why the knight doesn't fight back. He's literally carrying a sword, and risked his life getting there. And why doesn't he continue running after tripping? Why does he just decide well I guess I'll just die when Fiona's running after him? Kind of bad writing there, but otherwise, very interesting.  This could be the next generation of creepypasta. Having actual professional short movies based on fan theories. I wouldn't really want to see these as full feature length films because I feel like many of them wouldn't be able to manage for over an hour. But having shorts seem like a very satisfying concept for people who want to see these theories in a visual medium. Because of its length, these wouldn't have to be major big budgeted films either, but could still have passion and effort put into them."

Then the artists themselves  re-recorded their original tracks and ultimately, the actors ended up having to be reduced to lip syncing. Regardless if the actor approved of it or not, why not offer a different audio track on a Blu-ray or digital extra so a viewer could actually hear the actor doing the songs?? Why can't we, the audience, get to hear them and decide which we prefer?  I think it would be an awesome extra to have and see how well they did. I think films like the Buddy Holly story are the best in the genre for the very reason that the actor is singing the songs.   What say you?"

I have high respect for this movie, and I have so many good memories associated with it.  Bomb City (2017) was an indie film about my city, and was partially filmed in my city.  The premise, at it's core, is so simple.  Punks vs. Jocks, (No spoilers!)  I find it very personal due to the fact that I just left high school, was going to college for film, and was a very good movie made in my home town.  That and it was contrivercial as fuck when it came out.  No one talked about it, and no one really does.    Night of the Living Dead (1960) started my love for horror, and The Exorcist (1973) only expanded it.  But my real intro to a horror movie as a concept was The Texas Chainsaw Massacre (1973/2003.)  I went to an elementary school in the middle of a trailer park around the time the prequel to the 2003 film came out.  All the tougher redneck kids were talking about how awesome the movie was, trying to look cool.  I wanted to fit in, but admittedly, my parents were pretty sensible not to let me see it.  But then I saw it on YouTube when I was 13 or 14, back when people uploaded whole movies to YouTube in parts.  But funny enough, people thought it was lame by the time I had saw it.    Titanic (1997) was my first kind of mature movie.  Like, it felt grown up to see this movie, but as I grew up, I fell out of love with James Cameron's film, and fell into love with the 1958 film, A Night to Remember.  Honestly, I love both of them equally, but props to Titanic for sparking my interest.  Anyway, that's enough from me, what are some personal favorites for you and why?"

Finding out about the escape just felt really forced. Still enjoy the movie a lot though, just was wondering if anyone else had any input on this moment in the film.  Edit: this article on medium.com explains the point better than I do.   “Commodus has discovered his sister Lucilla's secret feelings about Maximus, as well as her desire to oust him from his imperial position in order to reestablish Rome as a republic. As such, he is now indirectly threatening her son Lucius — thus terrifying her into spilling the beans about the plan underway against him — so he can squash these plans and ensure total command over his empire.  But do you also remember how he happened to find this out, mere minutes before the scene? Um… Lucius told him, by shouting out for all the world to hear that he wanted to be “Maximus, The Savior of Rome!” To which Commodus then naturally queried “Who said that?”  The scene cuts next to Lucilla entering the palace after her plotting, before coming upon her terribly vexed brother, who's now menacing both her and her child. This practically screams that it was Lucius's own mother who told him Maximus was here to save Rome. To which, when I watched the scene this last time, I responded with an actual, audible “WHY?! Why would she do that?!”  Because what do we know about Lucilla by this point in the story? We know from her father that she's wise; we know from Maximus that she has a “talent for survival;” we know from her own mouth that she's been living in a “prison of fear” since her brother became emperor and has only visibly gone along with him to save her son, whose safety is obviously paramount to her.  So then why in blue perfect hell would she tell him Maximus was the “Savior of Rome?” Why would this protective mother endanger her own son like that? Why would this talented survivor confide a secret THIS HUGE in a child, especially one that's around the Emperor so frequently? Why would someone this wise now jeopardize the plan she had — up to this point — so cautiously crafted in such a careless, idiotic way for no reason at all?  Plainly put: She wouldn't. That scene makes no sense whatsoever, given the pre-existing reality of the movie.”  Edit: some of y'all really need to take the nostalgia goggles off and admit when something is flawed, which is ok because it's still a fantastic movie."

So my idea is instead of giving him a normal car, I'd do more of a gag type thing of a famous movie vehicle that isn't really a normal car.

        "body": "I first watched the 1998 version a long time ago as a kid and mostly forgot about it. I recently rewatched it again and now I can't stop.   First, let me start by saying this movie is full of romantic comedy tropes, has several large plot holes (would parents in London really send their 11-year olds alone to an 8-week summer camp in Maine?), and has some dialogue that is so cloying it makes my teeth hurt. Plus the entire premise of twin babies being permanently isolated from each other forever because of divorcing parents is cruel at best and downright criminal at worst.   But despite all that, this movie is so adorable and wholesome that it's become a comforting experience that makes my heart so happy the entire runtime. If I've had a bad day, I can watch it to make me feel better. Heartbroken? Straight to it. It's a simple but endlessly rewatchable film for me.   Some of the things I love about this movie:  * Lindsay Lohan, full stop. She is an incredible child actress in this. The fact that an eleven year old can play two distinct characters, one of which has an accent, and then play the characters playing themselves again, is kind of mind boggling. A really good adult actor would have a hard time with that, and she pulls it off so wonderfully. She is adorable, has some incredible facial acting, and is completely the heart and soul of the movie.  * This movie has a lot of tropes but it also subverts them in good ways too. My favorite parts of the movie are when the girls' true identity is revealed to their parents/caretakers. There is no anger or frustration at all, simply amazement and joy at being reunited with what they thought they had lost forever, and that never fails to make me go all teary.  * The butler/nanny characters are not only some welcome comedic relief but do a good job of showing how they acted as the surrogate for the lost parent for each of the twins and made sure they grew up relatively normal. They are both also a big reason this film has such a big heart.  * The two parents played by Natasha Richardson (RIP 🙁) and Dennis Quaid actually have a lot of chemistry on screen, which is critical, but just as important is their parental chemistry with the two girls, which is also abundant and heartwarming.  * This is a Disney romantic comedy so of course there is going to be a happy ending, but it actually feels earned. The parents get back together but it's not a flip of the switch thing. In fact there are several false starts and it seems like they have failed only to succeed based on a shared mutual past and love of their children. As a parent myself, I find extra happiness in the ending, if nothing else for the sake of the girls.   This movie is not perfect by any means but it has a lot of soul and I just love it to death. If you've never seen it before, don't expect a masterpiece but give it a chance and I think you'll find it as cute and heartwarming as I do."

True Romance had that one scene where Patricia Arquette gets beat down by one of the baddies, and how it was shot to the acting, along with the music choice made it surreal.  Same goes for the ending to Man on Fire. Similar to how Gladiator used that Irish singer for conveying the feels, Man on Fire is equally as moving/sad.  Top Gun also is/was a monumental film judging by how Top Gun 2s opening is nearly identical, as a kind of homage to Tony. Tony went against Paramount execs decisions, went against the grain and we end up getting Top Gun, one of the most beautifully shot action and aerial film ever.

However, I think the movie actually made a better ending by fulfilling what Kate wanted all along. She had spent almost her entire life in hospitals, going through surgery after surgery. She knew the pressure it was putting on her family and on herself and she was tired of it. Her sister was created to be essentially spare parts and her brother was nonexistent in her mother's eyes. By letting go and forcing her family to do the same, she was giving them a chance at normality. Her parents would no longer be at odds with each other every time they forced Anna through another surgery and could focus their attention on the remaining kids.  The book's ending makes the meaning behind Anna's action pointless, she finally gains the freedom to choose just to fall back into being nothing more than parts. Her life ends with her becoming the only thing they intended her for. So personally i think the movie gave a more satisfying ending that felt right. Both sisters get to stand with their decision instead of their mother's. I would honestly love to hear others thoughts on this subject. Do you think the movie was wrong to change the result?"

        "body": "First off, nothing but spoilers ahead.   This is just a rant about Kingdom of Heaven, and how, over the years, I've strained so hard to like it. Even through the different versions and edits I have really tried to tell myself this is good film but what I always return to is the failure of the character Balian. (and Orlando. He did what he could with the script, but he's still a part of the problem in the end.) Kingdom of Heaven had infinite potential in its cast, a backdrop that was cinematic and epic with scenery, and a score that was sweeping. (minus the one musical cue stolen from The 13th Warrior which happens for no reason at the most pivotal moment in the film) -But it all came down like a house of cards because Balian is paper thin in personality and everything around him is gifted to him. Over the course of the film, Balian is; an expert blacksmith, a top tier swordsman, (despite what a 5 minute lesson might suggest) handed a knighthood as a Baron, given a ticket to the holy land on a boat which is destroyed at sea which only he survives, kills men who in theory should have been more skilled and experienced than he is, given an entire plot of land and people and loyal soldiers, thrown into the good graces of the king and his beautiful sister who both love him right away, given the command of an entire army and castle and even offered the damn throne. Now, I'm not saying this is what makes the character bad, but if you're going to give your protagonist absolutely everything, you need the balance of downs against those ups, and you need us to want to see him earn at least some of those ups. Balian not only doesn't earn those things, but he squanders them. I'll get to that in a second.  Next time you watch this film, play a little game where you listen to what Balian's friends and enemies say to him that are relevant and inspiring. Note how little Balian contributes to the dialogue and you see the second biggest problem; Everyone around this dude is cooler than he is. Observe as characters that are badass die-off while we're stuck instead with Balian, a man who sad-frowns his way through an epic that seems to push him forward like a toddler balancing on dad's shoes while he teaches him to walk. Why couldn't that German guy who fought with an arrow in his throat be the hero? We got like 2 seconds of him. Liam neeson was cool, he ran shit, but he's gone already. Imad ad-Din could have had his entire army come for Balian but instead he bows out of honor in losing a fight. Your quality will be known among your enemies, before ever you meet them, there's no comeback to that. Tiberius with his badass voice and no nonsense approach because he knows what's really going on. Sibylla is sultry and facing great emotional choices, Norton shines as a king without even showing his face, Saladin takes no shit, even Guy and Reynald hold the screen better. Then there's our hero. F*ckin' boring. Gifted everything. Nothing cool to do, nothing funny to say. Ohh does making everyone a knight make them a better fighter?! ..yes... Not badass at all. Doesn't even make sense.  Lastly, Balian is given a chance to save thousands of lives and kill one Guy, get the girl, and make a Kingdom of Heaven... but he doesn't do it because he has ..principles? and the movie ends in a confusing battle that doesn't even resolve and Balian ends up back where he started from. What a waste of time. Sure, it could be argued that this was the parallel of the crusades, but the message held no weight with this hero. Balian builds up his territory for his people and for what? To give it up when he had the chance to make a difference. The only good advice he gives in the entire film is to not chase Saladin into the desert, but this is already after he has given up the real chance to prevent it. Tiberius says there is no more Jerusalem speech and Balian just watches him leave and says one word, no. Still nothing worth saying so he fights a battle and goes on a film ending speech about how his men will fight to the death and he'll never surrender the city and concludes it by surrendering the city. I could go on and on but I'm tired of writing. I would love to hear if there's anyone out there with more opinions on this film. I'm not a professional critic. Am happy to read what you all thought of it."

She's rehearsing with the Berlin folk on Mahler's 5th, and she decides to move a trumpeter off-stage. It sounds dope. Terrific.   Field also establishes (over and over again) that Lydia's perspective as a conductor is to sublimate herself and channel the intentions of the composer. Also dope. Also terrific.   Here's the sticky bit -- Mahler specifically asks for off-stage players in his other symphonies. #2 for example, has an entire off-stage band!  SO, is Lydia not as good at her job as she'd like us to believe? Is her philosophy of interpretation bullshit? I refuse to believe this was just 'overlooked'. But was it? Ack! Halp!"

You buy him as this nice everyman guy and then as you delve deeper and deeper into the story you can see how sinister the guy is without Eddie having to do much acting.

        "body": "It has been said--and laughed at--before, but each year it becomes more true. Computers have enabled us to create almost any visual we want. We are limited by imagination and render time.  The problem, at least the way I see it, is that it's inherently unimpressive to take in.  It is not unimpressive *in principal.* Knowing the skill it took, the sheer number of people and the collective decades of work that went into it, those numbers impress. And the quality of their work impresses. But when you take those massively expensive, technologically groundbreaking visuals and make them into scenes in movies, they don't impress anymore. It becomes yet another kaleidoscopic color-scape that doesn't really mean much to me. When I want to see computer graphics pushed to their limits, I can get that in 3 minute doses on youtube. Mad Max's visuals are legendary, but if you remove them from the story context, they're arguably less interesting than Cyriak.  Why?  Story, of course. At this point you may be ready to bail because you're ready for this to turn into another they don't make 'em like they used to complain post. And I hope to prove you wrong. But yes, the answer is story--old or new, challenging or complex-- it's always story.  Story is the reason that we can be just as invested in Popsicle sticks and puppets as world-class CGI. People have cried (OK, *I* have cried) when Yoda dies in Return of the Jedi. And the quality of the workmanship by the Jim Henson creature shop impresses. And the puppetry by Frank Oz impresses. But if you put those same exact elements into a movie with a less comprehensible story (which may have happened, depending who you ask) then they no longer *impress* though they remain, factually, *impressive.*  So what am I supposed to think when people are telling me that I need to go see a movie for the visuals, when I'm already burnt out on the fireworks finale that is the average action scene? This, for me, is paradoxical. In a world where the limits on what a film can show have been obliterated, special effects *cannot* be the only thing that makes a movie worthwhile. It's like restaurants enticing customers by bragging about how indoor their plumbing is. It's a given at this point, and you only notice it when it goes wrong.  The most optimistic view is that people are so very invested in the story that it makes the visuals just that meaningful, and they mistakenly think that means the visuals are all that mattered. It's not uncommon for people to confuse story investment with being impressed by visuals.  But I'm not able to manage this optimism unfortunately, and I am forced to suspect that a movie which one must see for the visuals is one that I'm just not gonna get much out of. Because the visuals only matter if the story is good, and nobody is talking about the story."

I have never been a huge Disney fan, I'd rather watch a DreamWorks movie any time, but recently I've been checking new Disney movies to see what they've been feeding the new generation of kids. And I think it's fair to say, it's uninspired boring garbage.  The plots are extremelly predictable, the characters are one-dimensional and stereotypical, the dialogues are super cliché. Watching Strange Worlds in the theatre yesterday gave me a headache. The way these characters talked to each other reminded me of staged prank videos of 2010 youtube. The animation didn't look good, no matter how much money the spent on it, every character looked like another character from other animated movies. Lightyear also. It was the most boring, bland and sterilised movie I've ever watched. No remarkable struggle or conflict for a viewer to enjoy, only over-the-top cheesy emotional scenes with no value since we don't feel any connection to the shallow, poorly-written characters. Both these movies were supposed to be progressive and something we've never seen before but they managed to display more stereotypes and copy-paste character archetypes than any other dark disney movie of the past.   30 years ago, The Hunchback of Notre Damme managed to display both ethnic minority characters and a disabled person and humanise all of them, prove racism towards them is evil, make them all have a believable and inspiring arc and have a great story overall. What's more progressive than displaying gypsy and disabled characters as protagonists in a 90s movie? THAT was actually groundbreaking. I think the difference between Disney movies back then and the modern ones is that Disney used to animate already existing stories or at least existing concepts which all seem timeless and can be enjoyed by all ages at all eras. My parents used to love taking me to the theatre to watch animated movies with me because animated movies used to be family movies, not kids movies. I can't say the same for my future kids.   My suggestion for all animation studios that are still alive and still have a future (so many have closed down in the past 20 years...) is to give another chance to 2D animation and experiment with more mature plots. This polished, sterilised animation style has to go.  Maybe they should animate more classic stories and fairytales, with a modern twist of course to make them more relatable, and include more timeless and humanitarian concepts. Disney must understand that no amount of coloured or LGBT characters will make a boring movie interesting. No amount of dramatic action scenes can save a plot from being unattractive to wide audiences.  Thank you for coming to my TED talk. Would love to hear your opinions on."

I don't know the actors, or directors.  Just that it was definitely demo worthy, high-action, great choreography and all the moto riders were dressed head-to-toe in black, including blacked-out visors.  Maybe they were wielding Uzi machine guns, IDK.  Always wanted to watch it, but never knew what it was called.  For some reason, as I type this, John Woo comes to mind -  though that might just be some random association."

I just watched it for the first time and already need to watch it again! So many questions! Is it all in his head? Did he really do the murders? Here are questions that I personally have kinda arguing why I personally think it might be mostly in his head:  If it was real, how come when he kills Paul, there's no blood anywhere besides him and the body? Could've been just director error, but the film was so well made otherwise, I don't see them skipping that detail..  If it was real, then how come no neighbors came out and called the police when the prostitute screamed and ran down the hall banging on doors? And, he was running naked and bloody with a chainsaw, and no one came out? He would've had to go back to the apartment and clean up and get dressed in order to go home, how come no one called the police?  If it's real, then the whole lawyer scene was just strange. Yeah, could've been him saying “hey man, shut up. Secret is safe with me.” But I draw back to the fact that earlier in the movie when he was talking to the detective (if he even existed) he said that Paul was gay and that it wouldn't surprise him if he was in London with a man or whatever. What if the lawyer was his lover? Why else would they both be in London?   If it's real, the landlord lady? That whole thing was weird too, like yeah maybe she covered the whole thing up, but she did kind of look frightened by seeing Patrick. Maybe she knew he would be the only one who knew about all of that? This one I'm still in the air about.   I could maybe see the homeless/random person killings being real, but I really don't know if all of them were. I think that a lot of them were him imagining them while listening to his walkman at work and drawing and kind of zoning out into a trance like state. Would love to hear what others think and any cool theories about it you wanna share!"

        "body": "Alright, I found the ending wholly unsatisfying and there are a couple of reasons. I'm going to first present my changes I'd make if I were one of the writers and then go over them after the bit. The goal is maximum satisfaction with minimal changes.  First and not part of the ending changes, ejection wings need to have been used or otherwise setup earlier in the movie. It could have just been a throw away line of dialogue when discussing the newest ships specs, that there wasn't a settup to that payoff was just sloppy writing.  Okay onto the main changes, we're keeping everything the same up until the fight on the bridge of Old Buzz/Zurg's ship (except for adding the wing settup).   Izzy and Sox see the fighting going on across the gulf of space, they start their jump and miss sooner into the action. The bump into the console that causes them to miss also destroys the console this is also where we get both Buzz and Old Buzz stunned. Under the bridge Izzy manages to grab hold but Sox does not and to save him she has to fully let go and leap into the void facing her greatest fear, but even though Sox is a robot she's not ready to let him go into the thing that scares her the most alone. But now she can't get back to the ship without help. So she radios Buzz.  Back on the bridge we get a perspective shot of one of the Buzz's opening their eyes when they hear a voice calling for Buzz to help, but what they see isn't Izzy it's Alisha her grandmother. They call out “I'm coming!” and that's when we realize it's old Buzz's voice. Old Buzz goes out the airlock in the Zurg suit and goes to rescue who he thinks Alisha but when he gets there the blurriness fades and he has a moment of anger/fear/not understanding “who are you? You're not Alsiha! “No, I'm Izzy Hawthorn her granddaughter, who are you? How do you know my Grandmother?” We get a shot of Old Buzz's face in the Zurg suit, a look of recollection crosses his face, flash back to him briefly seeing her after returning from one of his missions, of him seeing the hologram of her talking with her grandmother about him, he realizes the terrible things he's done and what he was about to undo, he brings her back to the ship.  Back on the bridge young Buzz greets them and then gets to tell Izzy how proud Alisha would have been of Izzy facing her fear and saving Sox. Old Buzz seeing this them collapses and the helmet mask thing comes off. Izzy is now faces with the realization that the man who was attacking them and doing those terrible things was also her grandmother's friend. Sox also is confronted with why there are two Buzz signals, and the remains of the old destroyed Sox. There's not too much time to ruminate on it though because the console being smashed means they can't stop the self destruct sequence or the rampaging robots. They're going to use the teleporter to get back to the ship but Old Buzz looks at the destroyed Sox guiltily not willing to go because of the guilty of what he's done. The current Sox puts his paw on him though and says “She wanted us to help you help yourself through your guilt”. And he goes with them.   They teleport and the ship still explodes before they have the fuel crystal loaded. Buzz gets the crystal and loads it into the ship but they still have too much inertia and some of the control surfaces were damaged so Buzz still does the thing with the wings to try and save the ship but it's not enough power. Old buzz goes out of the ship in his Zurg suit to help him, he takes the load and Buzz acts like a rudder or aileron. The rest of the team all still do their stuff but the landing's still rough and the Zurg suit is badly damaged. They get out to check on Old Buzz and it turns out his lower back was broken in the crash and he can't feel his legs.   The authorities arrive and Old Buzz agrees to do the time for the things he did/was going to do. He looks to young Buzz as he's being brought away, You know I did this all because I just wanted the chance to fly as a ranger again and now I never will. You'll have to fly enough for the both of us.   The crystal is used not to send everyone home, because now the population is too large on this planet to take the ship back. Instead they use it to send representatives to establish contact with the larger human civilization. Distant relatives of families that were separated when the science ship was first stranded are finally reunited. The misfit crew then get to become the Universal Protective Galactic Rangers or whatever. Young Buzz and crew get ready to launch back at mission control we see Burnsides watching as Old Buzz helps with the launch from control side with exosuit/robotic legs to help him walk and one of the wrist monitors Darby was wearing.  So, I think this fixes the issues that I found unsatisfying with the original ending. First the emotional catharsis didn't feel like it was there in the original ending, I think this brings more feelings to it. It addresses old Sox death, gives Izzy more of a moment confronting her fear, Old Buzz learns a karmic lesson and gets a chance to move on. Second, Disney is surprisingly blood thirsty when it comes to villains, without giving them the chance for redemption, and I think some examples of empathy/restorative justice are good examples to make. I don't think taking a life should be done as easily as it is in kids movies, even if they're a bad person. Third, this addresses an issue I had with them film that was really never addressed and that's what about the people where the Tulip came from? You know, their mission control, and their families, and the world they left behind. Yes, they started a new one on the new planet but still it's weird that they all just became okay with not letting Earth(?) know what happened to them. Finally, I know it's a kid's animated movie, but Buzz using the wingsuit to support and steady the ship broke my suspension of disbelief. I could more easily swallow it and suspend disbelief if the beefier Zurg suit was also pitching in to help. And I think that covers it."

I also like how they had more heart than expected and they covered all these different stages of life and how the whole series actually has the theme of growing up. I liked the characters and actually felt sad at the end of the last one. Anyway, American Reunion is one of the better legacy sequels I feel. The high school reunion setting is the perfect setting, the movie stays true to the characters in the original films, and finishes out all their arcs. The writers/directors are Jon Hurwitz/Hayden Schlossberg who went on to make Cobra Kai. The way they treat Johnny in that show is similar to how they do Stifler here. Taking the same character and transporting him to a new time and let him remain the same despite how the world around him as changed. Honestly, if you want to make any legacy sequel, hire these guys"

So one of the things I've always loved to do is watch animations in different dubbed versions to see how well the story sits across different cultural and linguistic settings. This kinda stuff fascinates me.   I'm using del Toro's Pinocchio (2022) as an example as it's a masterpiece in its own right, including its voice acting - and across all the languages it features. To know what I mean, watch the “Everything is new to me” part in the film where Pinocchio sings (scene where he is first introduced) in multiple different languages and just compare them to one another. It's a demanding song for a young voice actor and Pinocchio's voice sounds IDENTICAL across different languages.   Disney classics and Pixar films have also been amazing in casting very similar sounding voices across languages. How do they do this? How is it possible these voice actors sound like the _same person_ speaking different languages? Are these just genuinely similar-sounding people or are modern films using some kind of voice-changing technique to make sure all voice acting sounds true to its original actor's voice?"

Then later i think he (Daniel Brühl) got hit by a explosion which kinda messed one side of his face, and he fell in love with the nurse or they were already dating not sure. That's all I remember.

Even though we know in real life Hitler dies later on at his own hands, here Tarantino gives us the catharsis of watching him and the other Nazis get shot to death (and also burned alive) a bunch of times.   I've got this idea in my head of audiences watching the movie in 2009, filled with dread, because they know Hitler can't die yet so all our heroes are doomed to fail. It makes the fact that Hitler actually does die feel like such a cool, triumphant twist. But were audiences really as surprised by this as I like to think they were, or did they already sort of know going in to expect some historical revisionism? (I didn't watch it until years later.)"

But anyways, that's a topic for a different day. Today I wanted to discuss a different, though somewhat unexpected issue when at the theater with your friends. It's kind of hard to explain so let me try to explain it through a simple story.  So my friends and I are all talking and having a genuine good time as we are walking into the theater. We use the bathroom, buy our popcorn, etc. and then walk into our specific auditorium. As we walk up the stairs, we find the right row for us to sit in, walk down the aisle to our reserved seats. Whatever order we happen to be in is the same order we are in when we sit down in our seats. Now here's the thing: if you happen to be at the front or end of the group, then you likely got an edge seat, where instead of having two neighbors, you have one.  Now, I don't know about you guys, but this can sorta blow, especially if you are not as close with the guy you happen to sit next to. This definitely doesn't ruin a movie or anything like that, but it can really bug me out a lot more than I think it should and I was wondering what other people had to say about it. I don't want to be that guy who asks to switch seats. That just feels rude. Idk, there just doesn't really seem to be any good solution to it other than to position yourself smartly in advance haha.  Edit: so a lot of people have been telling me that this really shouldn't matter and that the fact I'm talking to my neighbors is pretty bad and I should just watch the movie. In hindsight, I totally get that and will keep it in mind going forward. But at the same time, is it really that bad to whisper to each other like a few times and share a few giggles that no1 else outside my friends will hear?"

He really imbues the character with pathos, and you can see the transformation take place over the course of the spirit visits. The supporting cast is fantastic as well, especially David Warner as Bob Cratchit.

That's the best way to describe his character.   I was laughing my ass off at his scenes, especially when he's having his temper tantrums. Ironiclly, many of the actors in that movie were giving subtle performances aside from Ralph Waite who yells like a virgin having her first penetration during his death scene. Joan Chen looks constipated through the entire movie and Steven Seagal just does what he does, reads his lines with no emotion while looking dazed. And don't get me started on his Greenpeace speech after he destroyed everything in sight."

(My eyes aren't tearing up I just have allergies)  I've been in love with movies since I was a kid and there are so many memorable cinematic experiences out there. Whether action packed, sci-fi, horror, dramatic or otherwise, movies can reach art form to me when they are relatable and I find some personal connection with them. So fellow movie buffs, what ends to which movies hit you the hardest? No wrong answers of course, this is all subjective!  My list is as follows in no particular order. (Spoilers)  **1.** *Braveheart*\\- FREEEEEEDOM!   **2.** *Gladiator*\\-  Father to a murdered son, Husband to a murdered wife, And I will have my vengeance... in this life or the next. Along with an astounding soundtrack what more can I say.   **3.** *The Sixth Sense*\\- The twist ending was out of this world when I first saw it in theaters but was also heart wrenching when Bruce Willis's character makes peace with his death as well as saying his farewells to his sleeping wife.   **4.** *Terminator 2*\\- Saw this for the first time at a hotel back in 93. Easily one of my all time favorite movie memories. More impactful than sad but nonetheless Arnie melting himself to the T2 theme. Whew   **5.** *No Time to Die-* Daniel Craig's Bond has mastered his way through nearly every situation he's been in but when he's inches away from peace with his family, his luck runs out. Couldn't Q at least make him a bubble suit? Sigh.   **6.** *Titanic*\\- Jack is a cool cat who sweeps a helpless Rose off her feet from the overly controlling and mundane existence with her rich fiance and mother. From Jack and Rose's fight for survival as well as the 2,240 other passengers as Titanic sinks, this movie tugs at the heart.   **7.** *Forrest Gump-* A masterpiece full of loss, joy, love, humor, and perseverance from a young man who seems slower than others but is probably sharper than a needle point.     Feel free add the same movies I've added if they've impacted you or different movies that hit you harder. I'd love to see some lists of movies I haven't thought of or perhaps haven't even seen.   ## "

Sonic was only redesigned because it was more than just fans who found the old look uncomfortable, and Jeff Fowler (or someone else I forgot who) was very well meaning about fans reactions and risked all the toy deals to make it more appealing.  It is very unlikely for any studio would undertake such a risky move. But what about the studios that did take that move?

Man, what a terrific documentary though. Touching and heartfelt. They ended up with such a great relationship that is so genuine and unforced, but you could also see the pain that RDJ still deals with when they discussed his early years and the regret from Senior was palpable in those moments as well.  That said, I don't feel like this was ever an unhappy film, it was bursting with life and creativity and the love of those things.  Thanks to the both of them for giving us a great film.

Portrayed as a gruff man of incredible power presiding over the largest battle in human history, a man who casually orders the suicide of battle-hardened high ranking generals when he sees fit.   However, when he picks up the phone and hears the voice of his boss, Joseph Stalin, he goes white as a sheet.  From television, but another example would the scene in Boardwalk Empire where Nucky Thompson meets with billionaire and treasury secretary Andrew Mellon.  Nucky, the main character, is not only a ruthless gangster but a wealthy legitimate businessman and a powerful political figure with all sorts of friends in high places and fingers in pies, the epitome of corruption and influence.   But when he goes to see possibly the most powerful financial figure in the country in a Diogenes club style retreat that looks like the kind of smoke-filled-room the Illuminati would hold meetings in, he looks as nervous and powerless as a little kid.

And boy, I was pleasantly surprised in the quality of the movie and was excited to the future ot Shrek's franchise!  As a huge fan of Spiderverse, I was so excited that it's style of animation was being felt in the movie. It's like the best blend of 3D animation and 2D drawings. There are scenes in the movie in which my eyes nearly pops out on the smoothness and stylistic choices of the animation (there isa scene that it looks like came from a comic book).. It should be seen to believed and I think it's the most accomplished animated film this year technically..  The story is simple but it asks difficult questions about mortality, the sense of being a family and someone's wish and version of happiness. I think IGN is right when they say it's like a Logan film.. The answers it asks may be difficult, but in the end it successfully wraps it up with a sense of accomplishment.. Kudos to the arc of the Goldilocks and Bears, it got me manly tears and Florence Pugh is really a star!  The highlight of the show is Perrito, the therapy dog. The film got so much laughs for his antics but underlying that is a sad story of a dog wishing for a family.. The themes of family is very pervasive of  and I'm so thankful that they handled it beautifully.   The voice cast is phenomenal. Antonio Banderas is Puss in Boots and his character arc with Kitty Softpaws is probably the best part of the film. Goldilocks and the Bear family is impressive and Samson Kayo as a baby bear is a standout! Salma Hayek gives her Kitty Softpaws character a sense of vulnerability and longingness that will delight you. The less said about Wagner Moura's The Wolf the better, you should hear him in screen to be really AFRAID..   Last but not the least, the humor is amazing. There are some references that will get heavy laughs tinged with sadness (Perrito, I love you!) .. The balance of humor with popular culture is top-notch.   Overall, this is one of my favorite films of the year and is leagues above the Disney/Pixar 2022 output. I really wish that it would win an Oscar since HTTYD didn't win any.. DreamWorks is in the roll and I'm excited for their future succes! I can't say enough good things about the movie!   5/5  Technically marvelous with outstanding voice cast, Puss in Boots asks difficult questions and answers them beautifully"

I would have loved a little rockin around the christmas tree while Santa bashes in heads, or all I want for Christmas is you. And what about Carol of the Bells or some Dance of the Sugar Plum Fairies for the house takeover/sneaking around scenes? All the music felt more like placeholder music/songs then the perfect tunes for the scenes. Or maybe the trailer song was just too hype for its own good.  Are there any movies you felt that (in your opinion) would have been improved by a different soundtrack?"

They can portray Lucifer as a kind of Loki character, where he tricks and deceives other angels to join his side. He manipulates them by saying how arrogant and narcissistic the Christ god is. And the angels would be like “yea, you know what? You're right, this is bullshit!”  Then at the end there is a massive battle between all the arch angels leading as generals of their legion of angels vs Lucifer and his army. At the end of the battle, Lucifer loses and god punishes him by sending him into the fire realm.   Then you see Lucifer and his army fall into Hell and you see them lose their angelic look and become more monstrous and demonic. But the Christ gods plan backfires because instead of being punished, you see Lucifer become the ruler of Hell, and at the end of the movie you see the newly named Satan plotting in hell for his next attack, with his legions or monstrous demons bowing to him.  I'm not even a Christian and I think that shit would be pretty tight…"

        "body": "I just finished watching this movie and it really stayed with me however all the reading I've done online afterwards, no one has presented this explanation of the ending so I thought I'd make my case.  *SPOILERS*  I believe Paul sexually assaulted Frankie on one of the nights at the hotel. The night that Paul is stroking Frankie's hair and they're discussing whether she'll stay in Scotland her whole life. After they cut away from that, it cuts to the song Tender by Blur and adult Frankie is in the club watching her dad dance with the lights cutting in and out. I believe every time this scene comes up, it's adult Frankie having a PTSD flashback. In addition, the use of songs and song lyrics are so crucial in this movie which doesn't have much music otherwise. And the most telling thing for me was the way the scene ends, ominously zooming out on their hotel door. Something is clearly happening inside.   Lyrics to Tender by Blur  Tender is the night lying by your side Tender is the touch of someone that you love too much Tender is my heart, you know I'm screwing up my life Oh Lord, I need to find someone who can heal my mind  The next day Paul is hanging out on the ledge of the balcony and looks like he's thinking about jumping. Later on, Frankie is sitting by the pool and she initially doesn't want her dad to put the sunscreen on her back (doesn't want to be touched by him). Which is out of character for her. I believe she's likely tucked away the memory of the previous night but feels a subconscious response that she doesn't want to be touched by him.  Later on that night, Frankie sings REMs Losing My Religion. Which I think is very telling of how she's feeling at that time, that was just a dream. It explains why Frankie was so upset at her dad afterwards, because she just wants to remember things as they were before, but him not agreeing to sing with her is a stark realization that things are now divided. It was not a dream.   At the end of the movie, Paul and Frankie have one final dance to Queen's Under Pressure. I believe this event triggers Frankie's memory of the terrible event that happened a couple nights prior. You can tell she doesn't want to dance but her father forces her. And at one point, you can see Frankie crying in her father's arms, almost struggling to get away. As a result, adult Frankie is now dealing with PTSD and the club dance scenes are how she's compartmentalized that memory. In addition, the Queen song's lyrics This is our last dance, This is ourselves, Under pressure explain a motive as to why everything has happened.   It's clear Paul is struggling with depression and where he is at currently in life. He feels pressure to be someone who's made something of himself at 30. I believe the purchase of the Turkish rug was an example of how flawed his thinking is, thinking that this rug will change his life or improve his relationship with his daughter. I don't believe we ever see the rug again. I think Paul latches onto the only person in his life who gives him unconditional and undivided attention. As a result, he makes the terrible mistake of confusing the love he has for his daughter as romantic love. And of course, their relationship never recovers.  All this seemed very obvious to me after I finished watching however most other explanations I've seen never mention any abuse and focus more on whether Paul killed himself at the end. I really think that point is almost irrelevant to the underlying theme of the movie, a child struggling to deal with a jarring event that happened in her past as an adult.   Let me know what you all think! At the very least it was cathartic to write out my thoughts on this movie, even if no one else agrees.  Thanks!"

Although these countries produce wide variety of content I think we should also see a other countries' approach in movie making. The success of parasite in Oscar's makes me think maybe more people will appreciate non english films. Maybe it's just me but I wanna experience other cultures on the big screen  With that said what countries do you think will be more popular or should be more recognize in cinema?  1. I think indian films are cool. I've only seen some amir Khan's  films so I'm not entirely sure. Not a big fan of the singing  parts but its tolerable and as I was surfing youtube last night, I'm surprise to  know that indian music have inspired some american songs. I think indian films getting more popular will not only promote their culture and philosophies but also promote exchange of ideas in music as well.  2. South east Asian films. I'll mostly talk about philippines but I assume other sea countries are the same like us culturally. Philippines have heavy folklore, we have lots of gory monsters and spirits, I believe other south east Asian countries are too. Westerns movies are usually about personal growth while Japan's are about friendships and teamwork, we are just like japan but I think on a bit bigger scale. Were all about collectivism, it's like the whole community is one whole family. Right now our cinemas is mostly bad or a copycat of other cinemas but i  think it'll get better if we embrace our culture more. I hope to see more of our values, philosophies and folklore on our cinemas in the future.  3. Chinese movies. We all know how fun chinese action and kung fu movies can be. Comedies are great too not just the kungfu comedy but film like cj7 is also great. Honestly, I dont know a lot about Chinese films, I love Jackie chan and I've seen some of stephen chow's hits, but that's that. I wanna see more of these films. Maybe its just nostalgia because these films are fun to watch as a kid but really I wish seeing this movies and I wanna see more of them.  These are some of my ideas what else do u think?"

However, rather than shitting on the movie, I want to see if anyone can answer some of these questions that leave me so frustrated.  - Why were all the cooks so obsessed with the main Chef? Why did they simply accept the idea of dying? It is told to us that he wasn't even the one who suggested the idea of everyone dying, it was simply another cook. I know the movie hints to the idea of it being a cult of some sort... But why? How? What's the context?  - Why does the Main Chef obsess with the protagonist girl 'Margot' beyond the fact she's also someone working in the service industry (as a prostitute). Why does he purposefully lie about them needing a barrel to make her fetch it? Why does his Right Hand of sorts shout You will not replace me!!! To Margot when she's trying to kill her? Wasn't she aware that they would all die in the end anyway? What does she mean with replace really? What was the purpose of creating such chaos in the first place for the main chef??  - Why is there an exact replica of the restaurant inside of the Chef's supposed Home where no one is allowed to enter? I assume that he was somehow planning it beforehand, but like... Huh? Does this mean everyone rehearsed it? In there? Why is it such a big reveal? Margot reacts in a way that expresses her surprise pretty openly to get the viewer's attention. The grey door seems to lead into a sort of special bedroom where it's hinted he even has (or had) a family. What's inside of the exact same door back in the main restaurant? It's clearly a big deal since Margot was told not to touch it when she was trying to find the bathroom.   - Why does everyone simply accept their murder? The clients, I mean. The Chef even remarks in an earlier scene that they could've easily escaped or somehow overcome their captors. But the peak of ridiculousness is them simply sitting down in place as they are dressed with chocolate and marshmallows just to watch the Chef walk in slowly and essentially murder them all.   - Was there anything deeper to Margot's date/client? Or was he literally just an insane individual? It is told to us that he was, for some reason, so accepting of his death that he went in knowing he'd die, just wanting to experience it all, even going as far as telling his girlfriend who breaks up with him. Could he really just commit suicide based on what the chef whispered? No matter how mean it was? And why *exactly* and how did he manage to have some personal contact with the main chef? He seems like a very deranged individual whose life revolves entirely around the restaurant.  - Margot was fearing for her life DEEPLY. And she found had empathy for the other clients, to the point where she openly tells them SHE called the coast guard to help them all escape. So why does she stop the boat and eat her burger like it's no big deal as she watches everyone burn to death? INCLUDING the innocent clients whose 'crimes' included going to a private college with no debt and acting in a bad movie. Is the answer really just Cause it's a dark comedy ????  These are some of the questions I can remember off the top of my head. I know this is supposed to also be a 'dark comedy' but I don't think it's an excuse for these things to be presented and have absolutely no explanation. The world SEEMS to be rooted in reality, so why do the characters behave so nonsensically??"

Spiderman 1 Villain looked maybe a bit silly, but tbh he was very terryifing in the way how he acted and while the action didnt look as spectacular with all the special effects as in the second one it was much more grounded, brutal and punchy. Here again, the first Spiderman felt overall grittier than the second one, though I agree the hospital scene in 2 was scary and an exception.  It's very likely a matter of taste, but despite that, the majority on the internet left me very confused.  LOL  &#x200B;  &#x200B;  &#x200B;"

They have no room for artistic movement and everything just looks too Disney/fake. The decisions they went with Willow is baffling as they're trying to modernize a fantasy. That's crazy. Star wars had no planning and the TV series have been up/down. Andor does differ a bit thank god.   Secondly it doesn't seem to ever think, let's do something new. Write a new IP from scratch, introduce a new hero. Next year I'm sure they'll do it again and ruin Indiana Jones."

Hilarity ensues as they try and bargain with each other to get what they want.  Discovering the importance of family: Check. Henry has some Christmas drama with his sons (including sentencing them to be executed) but ultimately realizes that family is the most important thing, and is unable to keep them imprisoned in the wine cellar.  A Christmas wedding: almost Check. Henry II arranges for Richard (his son) to marry Alais (his lover), despite her being betrothed to John (his other son). It all gets cancelled at the last second, however, when Richard discovers Henry is only doing it to get the Aquitaine.   Seasonal good cheer: In spades. How can you not feel good with a film that has such heartfelt dialogue as:  Eleanor: *My what a greedy little trinity you are: King, king, king! Two of you meet learn to live with disappointment*.  Henry: *Ah, but which two?*  Eleanor: *Let's deny them all and live forever.*  Henry: *Tusk to tusk through all eternity!*  Die Hard hasn't got anything on this film.

However Mamma Mia: Here We Go Again is, while not a great movie, an improvement; there's still not much plot but at least the dual plots with Sophie and the younger version of Meryl Streep's character makes things more interesting as does its emotional core, the singing and choreography are much better, the editing is much smoother, and there's more color in that movie than orange."

This was the turn of the century. Live action/CGI movies seemed all the rage, but most were poorly done or poorly written. Stuart Little was different. When it came out in 1999, it was well written, well acted, and the animation was stellar. I dare say it is a classic today.  Come 2002, when Stuart Little 2 came out. Everyone from the first film came back. I'd argue the second film is better than the first. By that time, Pixar had released two Toy Storys and A Bug's Life, but the animation in Stuart Little 2 still manages to stand up today. It's just a fun movie, with jokes for kids and adults. Plenty of jokes I remember from the sequel but didn't get until I had the internet to explain them to me; a hallmark of early 00's kids movies/TV that practically begged parents to watch the shows with their kids. Parents were also much more likely to watch shows with their children back then, instead of just turning on the TV and forgetting about it, so movies and shows had to contain a blend of humor fitted to kids and adults.   Stuart Little and it's sequel contain plenty of those “adult” jokes. The humor is clever, but tame for kids. The animation is immersive and hasn't aged a day. The performances are surprisingly good (who would've thought Dr. House would make such a good WASP).   It's an iconic part of my childhood, and I'm glad to enjoy it still, even as the years have passed me by. If I don't like watching Stuart Little and it's sequel when I'm 50, then I hope I die at 49."

This is bound to be a really divisive film and it will no doubt be talked about in years to come. The marketing was brilliant in how it didn't reveal much. I think the movie could defy expectations and be a legit Box Office hit like Black Swan.  The movie is overwrought and melodramatic but there's never been anything like it, at least that I've seen, in the cinema. And, like Requiem, I never want to watch it again. Fraser was amazing.

The second It movie, depicting the latter half of the novel, was masterfully done. The tension I felt in that first third of the movie (Chapter Two was a long film) is unparalleled. The perfect transition between the characters having suppressed their time in Derry and the full realization was masterful. It also established the secondary ability of Pennywise to befuddle the memories of adults who leave Derry perfectly.   That said, the film that had grabbed my attention raptly in the first 45 minutes slowly waned in the middle act of flashbacks, and lost my attention fully in the final third act. It felt like the ending of the first film in redux, but with more emotional weight attached.  I will admit that I haven't read the original novel, and I fully intend to when budget permits. I have no doubt that every effort possible was made to make a faithful adaption of the novel in the making of these films. I might as well be criticizing the latter half of the novel at the same time I'm criticizing the second film.   Having only seen the 2017 film and its 2019 sequel, I have to view it in that context. I loved the 2017 film, but the sequel is a compelling follow up that doesn't quite stick the landing. From what I understand, this isn't a major departure from most of Stephen King's books, so I guess my review is pretty generic in that regard."

It's still the same and I still love it. I didn't know how I remember so much from this movie. When I was rewatching it, it felt like I was watching from my memory as a child.  I don't even know the things that happened to me when I was 8 except for this movie. Which I clearly remember as clear as day and I'm so surprised.   Don't get me wrong 2005 has a lot of great movies I can kinda remember and enjoyed as well. There's Chicken Little, Zathura, Charlie and the Chocolate factory, Batman, Madagascar and even Constantine.   But Narnia still stood out for me the most when I was a child. Even though I grew up, I'm happy I rewatched it because I felt like my 8 year old self again. Even just for a couple of hours."

You could even do this in a mad lib style:  In [NOTABLE HISTORIC PERIOD], our protagonist played by [FAMOUS ACTOR] who's undergone [DISTURBING PHYSICAL CHANGE] is challenged by [TERRIBLE MENTAL ILLNESS] and [UNPLEASANT DISABILITY], dealing with [VERY SERIOUS SUBJECT]. Supported by [SERIOUSLY ATTRACTIVE ACTOR] in the role of a lifetime, you'll be sobered by it's [REAL DOWNER OF AN ENDING], but it's an incredible journey to witness in their first [IN VOGUE FOREIGN LANGUAGE] film."

It's a comedy about two down-on-their-luck cops trying to investigate a crime nobody believes has been committed. It's utterly ridiculous, with moments of low-brow comedy that verges on parody.   But the movie is also about how a big time investor has lost dozens of billions of dollars from a major corporation, is about to defraud the US government to pay back his losses, and nobody wants to do anything about it, to the point where they have to hand over the case to the head of the financial crimes bureau who also happens to be the investor's lawyer. With no other options, the protagonists have to go rogue.   It's a movie that insists on showing us that the big corporation which had people murdered and attempted to steal 32 billion from the Police pension fund just got a government bailout at the end of the movie, being too big to fail.   It's a movie that has a credit sequence dedicated to showing the audience what a Ponzi scheme is, and how absurd was the AIG government bailout.  Then, 5 years later, Adam McKay drops The Big Short, about how the utter corruption within the financial industry, and how collusion between government and private agencies led to the 2008 crash and the subsequent government bailouts. He's hitting the same theme on the head that he tried to do with the other guys, only this time in a serious mold.  I just find it hilarious how he had this idea, tried to say it in a comedy (ended up making one of the best comedies of the decade) then expanded that idea on a serious high-brow oscar contender starring Christian Bale and a boatload of other serious people.  What I'm trying to say with this, is don't go chasing waterfalls."

On the other hand there's nothing all that new narratively, Sid isn't funny despite Leguizamo giving it his all, honestly the movie in general is more mildly chuckleworthy than hilarious, and the other saber tooth villains are kind of dull and underwritten.  Also yes that baby isn't cute despite how the movie keeps insisting he is nor has the animation really held up (Some shots look fine while others look nearly Foodfight-esque).  But yeah it's not bad or horrible just nothing that special which is probably why this franchise, despite how many of them there are and how much money they made, never really got the cultural impact that Shrek or any of the Pixar movies or Frozen or Despicable Me or Encanto got, at least as far as the United States is concerned.

Now that it's on Netflix I really want to rewatch it high and see what's up. * **Bodies Bodies Bodies -** When I saw Pete Davidson was in this I thought it was going to be a very different movie and didn't expect it to be anywhere near as fun as it actually was. * **The Lost City -** The movie was exactly what the trailers said it would be. It was fun, it was silly, and it was cheesy. But sometimes we need that - All of us. * **The Unbearable Weight of Massive Talent** * **Bros** \\- I know this one didn't get a lot of good buzz but I really enjoyed it. At times it felt like the cinematography was a bit off, and it felt more like little vignettes more than a feature length movie, but overall it was fun. * **The Black Phone -** This hits a lot of the same notes as The Menu and X. * **Pearl** \\- A nice followup to X, and I loved the Wizard of Oz vibes, but I don't think it stands up at the same level. * **Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness -** As someone who grew up on Sam Raimi horror at an age way earlier than I probably should have been shown Army of Darkness, I think this resonated with me a lot more than it did with other people.  # Enjoyed far More Than I Expected  * **Elvis** \\- I've been thoroughly enjoying most of the biopics coming out of Hollywood lately, but I have no connecting to Elvis and mostly only went because my wife wanted to go. Ended up feeling like it was a little long, but wasn't at all mad about it. * **Dog** \\- I went in expecting a mostly generic movie, but walked out really liking the message. * **Sonic The Hedgehog 2**  \\- I think the first one was better, but I still enjoyed it. * **Fall** \\- As someone who hates heights more than anything, I spent the entire movie cringing in my seat. I'm sure it's not the greatest movie in the world, and I've definitely seen those twists happen before, but if a movie can make me feel the way this felt, I can't exactly call it bad. * **Scream -** There were certainly parts where I was rolling my eyes, like the point where horror movies always seem to have that the bad guy is down, and we should kill him, but lets talk instead, and now one of us is going to die, but I mostly think they did a good job with the update. * **Amsterdam -** The movie was long and it felt long, but I think it was a hell of a lot better than I expected it to be.  # Enjoyed it, but Probably Wouldn't Watch Again  * **Everything Everywhere All at Once -** It was fun. It was silly, but I don't think it was as incredibly as everybody else seems to think it is. If it's any consolation, my wife was in love. * **Ticket to Paradise** \\- Hit a lot of the same notes as The Lost City, but it felt like it ended on the wrong note and could have shaved a good 15 minutes from the runtime and been a better movie. * **Nope** \\- People love this one. My wife loves this one. I don't hate this one, I just have no interest in seeing it again. * **Thor: Love and Thunder -** It's the funny and silly Thor we've come to expect ever since Ragnarok, and I know some people are over it, but I enjoyed it. Though the movie was long and I wouldn't want to sit through it again. * **The Batman** \\- To me, the movie felt longer than it should have been and that it tried to do too much with its run time. I remember sitting in the theater and thinking, This is a natural stopping point, but than having to spend another hour watching more. I think I would have enjoyed this far better if The Batman was split into a 2 part movie to be fleshed out further. * **The Bob's Burgers Movie** \\- Anytime animated shows get pushed to the big screen I feel like the formula that makes them work feels off, and I don't think this was any different for me. * **Minions: The Rise of Gru** \\- It was cute, and I laughed. Though there was definitely a 15 minute portion in the middle I fell asleep during. * **The Northman** \\- It was a good movie, but a long movie. I didn't realize it was directed by Robert Eggers until I mentioned to my wife afterwards that it felt a hell of a lot like The Lighthouse - - -And then there was a fake mall shooting and we ran for our lives, so my recollection of the movie is. . .Tainted?  # The Mediocre Movie I Expected it to be  * **Uncharted -** I love the games, and this felt like a generic National Treasure sequel, but it's also pretty much exactly what I went into the movie expecting. * **Black Panther: Wakanda Forever -** I fully enjoyed the tribute to Chadwick Boseman, but the overall movie felt too long, and the storylines felt like they clashed more than they built off of each other. * **Black Adam -** I've become a little disillusioned with most DC movies so I didn't expect too much. So maybe it was slightly above my expectation. * **Where the Crawdads Sing -** Really loved the book, and while I enjoyed the film, I don't think it necessarily did the book justice at all. The movie had a firm beginning and end, but it didn't do enough to setup any of the important relationships to make any of the story really feel strong. * **Don't Worry Darling -** I think this tried to hit a lot of the same notes as Men, but did it a lot better, though, I still thought the whole thing was long and convoluted. * **Beast -** Didn't hate it. Didn't love it. My time wasn't wasted, but my mind also wasn't blown. * **Halloween Ends -** I really enjoyed the first movie in the new trilogy, hated the second one, and this one felt somewhere between the two. * **Fantastic Beasts: The Secrets of Dumbledore -** Similar to Halloween this one felt like it fell between its two predecessors. I feel like the whole franchise had a Dumbledore problem that could have been solved with him having his own movie, but it was still a step up from the travesty of the second movie.  # Expected More and Left Disappointed  * **Violent Night** \\- I was hoping to get something more like Krampus. I never expected the movie to be amazing, or have a real message, but I did expect to be laughing in silly ways.  * **Jurassic World Dominion -** It was bad, that is all. * **Studio 666** \\-Again, I never expected this movie to be good, but I did expected it to be at least fun. And I didn't find it to be anything more than forgettable.  # Worst of the Year  * **Men -** I felt like this movie had a lot it wanted to try to say, and that there was a lot of heart behind trying to make a point, but that it just didn't succeed on any of those points. I left the theater with my wife imagining a Goose at the end of the tunnel making the signature tones. . And that thought alone was better than the whole movie. * **The Invitation** \\- I left the theater feeling like a dozen recent movies did what The Invitation tried to do, but better. It was basically Read or Not, but nowhere near as good.  # Hoping to See by the End of the Year  * Devotion * The Whale * Avatar * Babylon * I wanna Dance * A Man Called Otto"

I'm a big Aubrey Plaza fan and this is some of her best work I think. It's probably her juiciest and most complex dramatic role, and she does still get to use a bit of her trademark sarcasm that's so amusing. And all of the supporting performances are solid too. Theo Rossi in particular is good at being mysterious yet still likable.  The story and how it's presented reminded me of Uncut Gems, which I thoroughly enjoyed, but I liked the more low-key approach this took. The tension is still palpable but it's not nearly as loud and stress inducing. It makes everything seem so easy and matter of fact, making it easier to understand why Emily does what she does. In a way, I think this is a bit more realistic than Uncut Gems.  It's technically proficient as well. It's edited into a tight 90 minute package, and that combined with the cinematography find creative ways to capture the more frenetic moments. I hesitate to call them action sequences, but they kind of are, and regardless, this clearly had a pretty low budget, and doing those scenes couldn't have been easy.  I would've liked to see this in theaters, actually. I really dug it, and I'm glad to see it so high on the Netflix charts already."

So I was quite pleasantly surprised with how good it was when I finally saw it.   Barbarian meanwhile, has a deliberately vague trailer that didn't give its plot away. I won't spoil anything but wow. I did **not** expect the movie to turn out the way it did. Twists and turns at every second. Just a fun, unpredictable wild ride at the cinemas.   If you're planning on doing a horror double feature, definitely try watching these two back to back. It's truly one hell of an experience."

When he goes back and sees the place cleaned up, what was the point if ultimately the alts we're going to reveal themselves. Off the bat, I'm convinced the wife that went back with the real hubby was the Alt wife. Now as far as these alts, if they're real and this isn't some trippy hallucinations from the weed, how are they produced to look so much like the originals. I mean, they weren't just twins they were clones. So is this magic. The force shield definitely shows what we're seeing is real and not some imagination. Also, why have the patient files on the property; it was meant to be discovered. Mostly I was disappointed by the reveal of the alts; if they kept the psychological thriller aspect going the movie would have had a deeper meaning, instead we're just dealing with magical realism and things are too conveniently explained away."

Heard it was adopted from a short story so perhaps there were some heavy edits by the screenwriters.  **Stuff I cheered at:**  * Finally seeing an alternative Black girl giving that goth/emo/punk feel as the lead in a movie. There are so many girls like that but we still don't see them on screen.    * Also, she does cheerleading! We don't have to stick to stereotypical tropes. * Cool to have a movie centered around a relationship with two girls where romance isn't at the center of the drama. Conflict can be created over the most mundante things. * Better stories about grief and dying. It's not always sadness. There's a mix of emotions and we'll all experience it at some point. * Showing a healthy father/daughter relationship. Awesome to see a dad check in on their child, make dinner and be aware of stuff happening/people in her life.  **Stuff that made me scratch my head:**  * Why are we trying to develop friendship between an *obvious bully and outcast*? At the beginning, it is clear that Capri (the queen bee) goes out of her way to tease/torment Darby: >!calling her 'freak show', embarrasing her in class, stealing her clothes after Darby's showered.!<    * >!Nevermind, that they used to be friends and had mutual respect for their athletic abilities. Nevermind that she knows Darby's mother died when she was a kid. Nevermind that Darby isolates herself to protect herself from more bullying.!<    * >!Capri demands that Darby do what she wants and when Darby refuses, she plunges her head in a toilet. !<She keeps sabotages Darby until she gives in throughout the movie, never apologizing for the hell she put Darby through. * Why is she a free-of-charge social worker helping dead people move-on? >!She started doing this as a 6-year old and her father was okay with this? She never gets tired of this job though she never wants to talk about her own mom dying?!< * If we're going to have an 'alternative girl' character, can we do more than just show that she likes the color black? We hear some alternative rock in the movie but you don't see why she's interested in this culture. Just seeing dead people doesn't justify wearing black nearly all the time and then suddenly being okay with pastels after a makeover. * Unneeded romantic plot. >!Yes, Capri lost her boyfriend but why add a weird romance between him and Darby? Did she even like this guy? Their interaction was basically Darby giving free grief counseling. !<The plot by itself was interesting. * Obvious teen movie cliches: climbing social status in less than a month (the mean girls are suddenly letting her in the clique after hating her for several years), a nerdy boy having a glow up after middle school and becoming the 'hot boyfriend', ditzy/vain girls, immature/stupid boys,..."

For a little context, RRR is a tollywood movie, which means that it's original language is Telugu which is spoken in a couple of states in the south of the country. Unlike what most of the world believes, all Indian movies are not Bollywood; that refers only to hindi language movies, and there are many languages in India.   It's hard to describe what this movie is about because it bends genres like there's no tomorrow. Its plot briefly is this - RRR is about two men living in colonial India. They work for opposite sides and are fated to be pitted against each other, but without knowing each other's true identity, they become the best of friends. This movie has elements of everything. It is an action, drama, rom com, musical and buddy comedy movie wrapped in one and it. is. amazing!!!  The director, SS Rajamouli has really created a masterpiece. Everything is perfection. The character and world building is done so perfectly that what usually would be ridiculous and cringey is completely believable and fun here. The characters are nuanced and insanely well acted. The directing, musical score and dancing are out of this world, and the rewatchablity value is high.   Yes, it may require a certain amount of suspension of disbelief and a big chunk of your day (3 hours) to get through, BUT if you can get past that and be accepting of a few cultural differences in movie making, I assure you, it is going to be a VERY rewarding experience. It's in my top 3 movies this year and maybe of all time just for the sheer enjoyable nature of the film. Go check it out!  EDIT: Here to boost my Watch RRR campaign (LOL) by adding that they have just been nominated for a golden globe in the best non English language film and best original song. Love that for Indian cinema!"

I know im probably not the first to make a post like this...  I know the ending is a contentious issue with some people, is he asleep, is he dreaming, we never see the top topple at any point and it's left ambiguous as to whether or not he is asleep. The main point that many sleepers point to is that the kids haven't grown and are wearing the same clothes. The awake crew focuses on the top bobbling, and that he finally sees their faces.  As someone watching this with a different perspective on life now that I have kids, I still believe that this is relaity at the ending, however I now fully understand those who state that no matter what, reality or the dream, Cobb doesn't care because he's with his children. And this struck a huge emotional cord with me that it didn't before, and I completely understand him not caring if the top fell over and running to his kids because at the end, thats all he wanted and all he fought for the entire film.   My best friends son died in his sleep last year at 11 months old, and I know the personal hell he and his wife went through and Contiue to go through .  If I could chose a world where I was with my kids over another one, real or not, I'd chose that one 100% of the time.

Wanton death and destruction in a desert wasteland, complete with culty marauders with a masked muscle-bound leather daddy leading them, a feral child, and DIY hotrods in a car chase fight.  I can barely imagine what happened between Mad Max and this that would change everything so much, but I really enjoy the speculation.  You can definitely see that Miller had a lot more money to make this film.  For what it is Mad Max is an excellent film with one of my now favorite villan performances and one of the best car jumps through another vehicle scenes every put to film.  The Road Warrior however, in my opinion, is the superior film simply because the story moves so much more quickly and precisely, and the world itself is built in a way that you can almost feel the desperation of its inhabitants.  It is by no means perfect and there is one part in the film that I could honestly do without, but I chalk that up to my personal sensibilities.  What are your honest thoughts on The Road Warrior?"

Sometimes those elements aren't limited to a single film, and mark a film from a particular time because of how pervasive those elements are at that time.

Then they get into this dance/ musical number and at the end of the song, the kids smile. Because of this, they get put into a cage. Another specific thing I remember was their “jail food” was served in this big wooden bowl and a wooden spoon. This is so freaking random and terribly explained but if anyone can find this movie, it would be unreal.  Other things about the movie: - was made roughly in the years from 2009 and before, since that was when I watched it  - the movie COULD be Aussie (since I'm from Australia and it could've have been some niche children's special in Australia.

The animation is fun and immersive. The music is also pretty good (i really liked the spanish harmonies with the electric guitar).  Thing is, this movie can be really dark and mature if it wants to be, and can hit you in the face with it's tense scenes. The way it handles Puss In Boot's relation to death is surprisingly dark and realistic and will definitely get children frightened. Two of my favourite scenes are the ones that touch on this side of the movie. One being the intorduction of wolfy boy which was shivering, and the other being a scene where PIB straight up has a panic attack. These scenes in themself are worth a watch in my opinion.  The unfortunate part is that the movie has an awful sense of humor like 85% of the time, and besides those scenes i mentioned above, it constantly drops jokes like every 5th sentence. And it's not just the comic relief character that does it...Literally everyone except wolfy boy. Wolfy boy has zero jokes in this movie, which gives the whole experience a bipolar up and down feeling with him being on the screen (which are the best parts of the movie tbh) and off. It wouldn't frustrate me this much usually, but DAMN...This movie could have been on another level and just way more coherent if it had just tuned it's humorous tone down and tried to come up with better jokes. Some of them kinda hit tho, but not many for sure. This also doesn't help with getting to like the main trio, but luckily some scenes got me attached to them by the end.  The movie left me liking it in general. I would even go as far as saying that this is the best animated movie of the year (even though we didn't have too many good ones).

Due, to its rising popularity in sales of this toy, most of the retail stores were sold out and this father went and had this ongoing feud with this mail post office carrier who he was a father himself who's trying to get the toy.     Really fun and enjoyed this comedy family friendly film and noticed that a pro wrestler Big Show was in the movie portrayed as Giant Santa in that Warehouse brawl scene. The parade scene was also fun to watch how Arnold went and put on that Turbo-Man costume seeing him showing off these action hero abilities. There was a sequel to this, however, from Larry the Cable guy and it was just cringe and terrible to watch."

But despite my stance of being problematic isn't the end of the world I find myself taken aback by things in older favorites I never noticed before.   The new Indy 5 trailer got me excited to watch the originals again. They've always been favorites but I realized I hadn't sat down to watch them through in some time.   Suffice it to say I was floored to see straight up yellow face in Raiders. A white stunt man with prosthetics made up to look Asian. I've seen Raiders dozens of times yet somehow never noticed until now.   It threw me for a loop, to be honest. There is also brown face in the film.   I will always consider Raiders one of my favorite films ever. Temple of Doom, which is more controversial, is my favorite Indy film period.   But I won't lie that these poorly aged elements aren't something of a sore spot to grudgingly get past.   I want to make it clear that I'm not talking about canceling anything nor am do I want this to devolve into a screed about political correctness and anti-wokeness.   I want to have an open discussion on how fellow film fans personally reconcile offensive aspects of films they love."

I told my roommate who was choosing with me, She told me to read the bio and immediately i thought i wouldnt want to watch that. A man finds out his wife has been fantasising with another man and sets out in an orgasmic journey... - something like that.   But alright. Let's watch.  The start was definitely in line with what i expected. Straight out with nudity and superficial talk, jealousy, the potential man of the wife's fantasies...  What i didnt expect was how captivated i was by such slow scenes. The plot is outlandish but believable at the same time, the characters act normally (for the most part), the dialogue, the performances are incredible! The interactions, the looks, the back and forth. I thought this part was great.   However, the true masterpiece is in the entire setting.   The combination of the lighting, the MUSIC, with the things i just mentioned meshed together to create one of the best movie experiences i've ever had.   The piano made me Cringe every time it played.   They didnt give out too much information to maintain the suspense which is also in line with the vibe of the film, the secrecy of the organization and such.   I was constantly under the impression that this did not give me a fincher vibe... If i had to Guess, given i hadnt seen anything like that before, id say it was Kubrick from what i had heard about him, but i was pretty sure i had seen fincher at the start... Alas, i didnt, i mustve misclicked and mistakenly, and thankfully, introduced myself to Stanley Kubrick's work.    What a masterpiece"

Also, I've noticed on Reddit in general if something goes against popular consensus to any degree, people don't respond with thoughtful feedback but just downvote or even try to get a post banned.  Re-watched Get Out for the first time since its release and recognized its strengths more easily this second go-around. I remembered very little other than the main plot points and general themes.  The concepts of slavery and white envy of black physicality were innovative and thoughtful, if perhaps too obvious thematically and not particularly deep. Get Out also approached the perspective of how woke liberals contribute to modern-day racism by convincing themselves they are not racist and re-appropriating black culture in different ways, definitely worth exploring.  However, the film is all over the place in terms of tone (not the first time I've heard this complaint); it's a horror/satire/social commentary/sci-fi/thriller mish-mash that works most, but not all, of the time. The above themes are introduced well in the first two acts, but the third act turns into a sci-fi thriller less concerned about race and more about survival.  The humor initially struck me as repetitive: How many times can a character insist his friend has become a sex slave? Even though the character's making a point about actual slavery, it still gets stale.  The fact that I've thought so much about the movie, and especially how its themes translate to real-life liberal culture, is a testament to its power. It's very interesting to me to see how others think the movie takes place in a red state or that the Armitrage (sic?) family is somehow brainwashed.  Which leads me to my final point, which I know will cause some controversy. Every single white character in this movie is evil or awful. From what I recall about Us and Nope, that's largely the case as well. This is fine if the antagonists are well-developed, but they seem more like plot devices than actual people.  Basically, I think this is like an 8.5/10 movie -- but is often boosted in terms of reception because it arrived at such a culturally relevant time (when Trump came into office).  I can't help but compare it to Kathryn Bigelow's Detroit, which arrived around the same time and was basically a horror movie about the Detroit Riots in the 1960s. That movie was flawed, too (have to rewatch, but there was a white savior complex aspect) -- but I felt it was much more intense and showcased stronger writing, as well as deeper characters. My reaction to that was very visceral; I remember leaving the theater thinking This is the best movie of the year.  **EDIT:** I don't remember Us other than the scissors and scratchy voice and the final image. Nope was super meh and really cheated us out of a Charla Nash comedy. What a thoughtful discussion this was. I leave you with these two top comments from the New York Times' Best Movies of 2022 article -- which, if it makes you happy, saw Nope claim the No. 1 spot.  You know you're allowed to criticize Jordan Peele, right? We don't need to pretend that the epically lackluster Nope is as good as his other films. If someone said Get Out was the third best movie the year it came out, yeah that would make sense. But Nope was just bad.  Nope? Are you serious? The movie is illogical and silly, if anyone else had directed it you would be awarding it razzies. The characters do not grow or change--indeed, they are barely characters at all, with a goal (selling a photo??) that is absurd and unrealistic. The cruel, unnecessary scene with the monkey is disconnected to the story of the film--it is backstory to a side character that is barely in the film. Much of the film is too dark to see what's happening; the dialogue is mush-mouthed, and oblique to the point of being incomprehensible. The creature design is little more than a classic flying saucer with a hole in the bottom. There are no moments of emotion, or tension; the rules they establish are instantly violated with zero ramifications; and the ending is a cheat. No just a bad movie, but easily one of the worst movies I've seen in years, it makes US look coherent. I've never disagreed with the two of you more."

Robert Loggia was ridiculous with that Cuban accent and moustache, even the scene where he's pleading for his life is comedy gold with the pay-off, or MIriam Colon playing Pacino's mother (?), even though they look the same age, ranting and raving. Even poor Mary Elizabeth Manstrantion got her one big scene, where she goes from being the normal one to being just as wacko with no explanation.   The best performance, in my mind, came from Michelle Pfeiffer as Elvira. She seemed to be the only one taking it seriously, adding subtlety to her character, but that only makes Pacino's overacting more obvious when they share scenes together.   Good comedy but not a good movie. I think this was a hit because it was entertaining to see and extremely violent."

        "body": "After having finally getting around to watching it, I can say it's definitely one of my favorite movies that I've watched all year. The movie managed to keep me on my heels the whole time with its constant pace, yet never managed to feel like a rushed film.  I feel as if every main actor executed their role well, especially Javier and JLaw.   Javier managed to portray a narcissistic obsessed creator, who disregarded the trouble strangers brought to his wife, who in this case is Mother Nature, and forgave and welcomed them as they kept coming. In the bible we also frequently see just how much God himself claims to be a jealous God, who wants his creation to give thanks and praise him, and though it may seem unfair to his wife, having the burden of continuously forgiving the people who are damaging your home, must bring upon lots of strain and isn't for the weak. We see how Javier couldn't care less about Earth (home), because just like in the bible,  Gods creation of humans are the most important to him, and the Earth we live on will soon be anew, hence the reason why we see a new girl at the end of the movie.   As for JLaw, her performance was amazing. Her constant panic and hyperventilating kept me on edge the whole movie, and it didn't let me slip away once. In this film she is seen as Mother Nature and how humans are constantly destroying and tearing her apart, with little to no thought of it at all. Her battle with the strangers that destroy her home, resemble the damage people on Earth do today. One of the things that stood out to me the most, is she doesn't look for the help of strangers at all. She hesitates and feels uneasy when Michelle's character was assisting her with laundry, told the one person who was 'helping' her paint, how it wasn't necessary in the slightest, and she kept exclaiming how she renovated that house all by herself. This lines up with our real life, because Mother Nature would only benefit with us out of the equation. Jennifer would thrive if it was just her and her husband left in the house, where he wasn't responsible and didn't interfere with the house construction.   I will say though, I like the relationship established between Jennifer and Javier. Since the concept of there being a Mother Nature in a biblical sense doesn't exist, Javier being God has the power to end and create a new Earth, which would be classified to us as a Mother Nature/Earth. We see this at the end when he ends Jennifers life and a different woman wakes up to him. As much power as Mother Earth has, she is inferior to God at all moments. God's creation covers over Earth and people.   To cover some of the other allegories and allusions, Ed and Michelle are a reflection of Adam and Eve and how as soon as they broke the stone (Forbidden Fruit), they were banished from the private room they kept in the house, just like in the bible Adam and Eve were banished from the garden. Their offspring Cain and Able are also depicted when one of their sons die due to head bashing of the doorknob (rock), which may or may not be the same doorknob that was broken off by Javier earlier in the film. The rush of people claiming to gain power when the house transitioned to an apocalyptic setting, also symbolizes the antichrist and how people will rush to claim power, when Jesus comes back and the markings they will put on people for following them  Overall I appreciated this movie a lot. I didn't think the meaning behind it was too complex for the average movie goer to not enjoy. I was scared that this was going to be a forced  pretentious film, but it wasn't at all. If you did think it was pretentious, I would like to know why"

I think this is one advantage shows have over movies, and more specifically ones from this century. I'm not talking about cult classics or films released 25-30+ years ago (some even 80 years) that are still in people's mouths to this day, but moreso this century since these past 2 decades have been the golden age of television.   I see the most popular films from the last 5 years and the most popular shows from the past 5 years and you'd immediately realize there are more shows being talked about than movies. Even take subreddits for example: How many big subreddits dedicated to shows have you seen? Then compare that to how many subreddits dedicated to certain movies, barely any if none apart from franchises.   Are there any movies you know that have a big loyal fan base which are still talked about? I'm obviously not talking about films from this year."

Another Ferrante-style cold-eye observation of complicated interactions of selfishness and love boiled down under the breezes and rains..   &#x200B;  It's a walk journey of a woman, mother, and daughter in her 40s. The sets of a local gang, young mother and the old man build up a bridge between past and present. The memories of suffocation caused by babies, her lust in an affair, and peeling oranges repeatedly haunted her and somehow lured her into unsensible acts. We could see how a woman is trapped, buried, and lost under the duties of a mother and lost her identity. And how trauma in the past influences our present choices.  &#x200B;  But after all, she unravels her knots tied in motherhood, or even more before, her sisterhood.

Throughout the film, we see how the characters on the bullet train are all trapped in their own little bubbles, locked in a battle for survival with no regard for the lives of others. They are driven by their own selfish desires, whether it be for money, revenge, or personal gain.  But as the movie progresses, we see how their actions only serve to escalate the violence and chaos on the train. They are caught in a never-ending cycle of violence, with each act of aggression only leading to more retaliation and bloodshed.  In the end, the only ones who truly benefit from this chaos are the shadowy figures pulling the strings behind the scenes. They are the ones who profit from the destruction and pain of others, using their power and influence to manipulate the situation to their own advantage.  Through its portrayal of this destructive cycle of violence, Bullet Train serves as a warning against the dangers of unchecked power and the futility of violence as a means of solving problems. It reminds us that in a world where everyone is out for themselves, only the ruthless and the powerful will thrive.  So while some may see Bullet Train as just another action-packed thriller, I believe it has a deeper message about the dangers of unbridled aggression and the importance of empathy and compassion in a world that is becoming increasingly chaotic and unpredictable   What are your thoughts?

        "body": "As most are aware, there's been an increased push for more strong female leads and roles all around in Hollywood over the last decade or so. While I think this is obviously an overdue and noble pursuit, it's often resulted in studios going for badass girl-boss type characters while failing to write them as complex and multi-faceted. Certainly a step up from classic damsel in distress type roles females often occupied in many genres in the past, but this approach often results in flat roles that put female characters on an unrealistic pedestal that ultimately, in my opinion, fail to advance feminist ideals in the industry even though the intentions are good.  Certainly not the only approach, but one step I think screenwriters could take to create a more well-rounded diet for actresses today would be to attempt to write more great female villains. One of my favorite female performances of all time is Tilda Swinton in Michael Clayton. She's a cold embodiment of corporate greed and perfectly portrays the evil force in the world today of putting profits over people, but at the same time a convincingly flawed human dealing with her own internal struggles and anxieties. Absolute masterclass in acting as well as writing.  Just wanted to get the discussion started on this issue as I find it interesting from an artistic as well as sociological perspective, hope it's not too hot-button and sparks more of a discussion than debate. I'd love to hear any thoughts people have on what they'd like to see in the future of strong female roles in Hollywood or in the spirit of my example, some of their favorite female antagonists. Thanks for reading.

        "body": "*Mild spoilers for the film below*  I'm sure I'm not the only one who gave this 3.5hr 'exploration of a Belgian housewife's chores' a go in response to the BFI poll, where it's rocketed straight up to number one, and it's left me wondering *why now*? Citizen Kane, Vertigo, both hugely influential and uncontentious challengers for the top spot, but Jeanne Dielman is an achingly slow, experimental film that would put off your average viewer, whereas I think most of the other films on the list have at least some mainstream appeal alongside their artistic merit.  First, my impressions. I genuinely did enjoy the film and I definitely wouldn't say it's boring, at times it can become almost hypnotic like the rhythmic beat of train tracks going by. It's not entertaining exactly, but as long as you're in the mood for something a little more leisurely and contemplative then it's an easy enough watch. A rewarding one too.  Quick overview… we see our housewife going about her daily life in painstaking detail. A routine clearly refined over time down to mechanical precision. All her actions seem automated and perfunctory, with very little joy or expression, she's living largely to the beat of economic necessity. In focussing so closely on such minutia though we start to notice off-beats creep in. Her growing malaise, or perhaps frustration, is not depicted with emotional outbursts or verbal tirades, but instead with subtle shifts in her actions and mannerisms that convey her inner state. This is where the 'monotony' of the first day's routine pays off, as by familiarising ourselves with her fastidiousness, a later hair out of place or pot lid askew becomes as overt as a gun shot in any other film. Even that prolonged potato peeling scene becomes engaging; the sheer level of intimacy and familiarity we've developed forces empathy and you *feel* the apathy and weary resignation with which she goes about her task. There's a strong sense that the film is building to something but you're not quite sure what, which produces a 'soft tension' that keeps you engrossed.  In terms of themes, it obviously has a lot to say about the role of woman in society and I don't want to diminish or dismiss that message at all. However, I'm sure that particular theme has been talked about at length many times over, and that message was as true and pertinent in 2012 and 2002 (etc) as it is today, so personally I don't think it's why it's taken the top spot. Instead, I'm wondering if covid, and particularly lockdowns and other disruptions have pushed Jeanne Dielman to newfound relevance (finally getting to the point of this ramble XD).  Arguably the most profound impact of covid is that our own routines have been disrupted, and I think that's forced a lot of people to take stock of their lives. When living day to day, as Jeanne Dielman does, it's so easy to sink into comforting habits that carry you along. It's all too rare that we stop to consider our own satisfaction, sense of purpose or ambitions, they're sacrificed for a sense of reassuring predictability. Even as the mundanity wears us down though, we often don't notice until it becomes so prominent it warrants a label; stress, burnout, depression. I think covid brought to light a growing dissatisfaction with that way of life, a realisation that something, *anything*, has to change as humans aren't automatons. We can't dutifully perform the same tasks day in, day out without pause. Like Jeanne, eventually something has to give or else we break.  I think that's what I took from the film. A reminder to take some time to evaluate our own routines and life direction, and to consider whether it's taking us somewhere we want to go. Not that we're always given that level of agency of course, economic necessity plays a large role here too, but then that speaks to wider issues in society. Of course this probably isn't the film's original vision, but I hate to admit that I did resonate with the forced monotony of it all. I've certainly had long periods when I've coasted along without much thought until something derailed me, and then I've been amazed it didn't happen sooner. I guess every now and then, it's worth taking a stab at something new!"

I'm watching this to prep for the new Disney+ series, which looks masterful and epic. But I've always heard of this film, and I love Ron Howard (since I'm in the small minority who loves Solo: A Star Wars Story), so after watching this in its entirety, I'm happy to say that this was a lot of fun and I really liked how simplistic of a film it was. It wasn't too dense, but it was filled with personality and goofiness that had me feel nostalgic for old-school fantasy epics.  Warwick Davis is a living legend and he is instantly likable and charming as Willow Ufgood. Val Kilmer looks like he's having so much fun as Madmartigan, and Joanna Whitney is badass as Sorsha. I also really liked Jean Marsh as the wicked Queen Bavmorda. The rest of the supporting cast is also really solid, especially the Brownies, who were legitimately funny. The overall story and execution of this film is really interesting since at times it's super fun and lighthearted, then there are moments where it's straight up creepy and terrifying. Howard did a superb job at balancing these elements, and made for something unique.  The production design and editing is really good, and the writing is also great. The pacing in the first half is a bit slower than I expected, but it ramped up as the film continues. The visual effects and the practical effects were decent, however, there are many times where it looks extremely dated. Like, how the Brownie's green screen effect shows at times, and when a certain scene where Raziel gets knocked down, I could clearly see it's a stunt actress with a old woman mask on. I could give things like this a pass, but they were super noticeable. Also, rest in peace to composer, James Horner. This score is one of his best and is super catchy to the point of me humming the theme to myself afterwards.  Overall, what a mystical and wonderful film. Now, I'm ready for the legacy series.

I have a weird history with this film since I would always see the trailer for it before watching one of those classic Disney DVDs with “Disney FastPlay”. It looked cool and reminiscent to Atlantis: The Lost Empire, but I never got a chance to watch it. Until now…  In a nutshell, this animated film has a very ambitious world where there's creatures and animals as a pirate crew with a talking robot and a blob that can morph into tiny versions of things. Just tons of odd ideas that somehow became cool as the film continues, even to the fact that I've never seen a pirate sci-fi adventure ever on film. It's clear that the novel and animators worked their butt off, creating a world in one film and executing it in a fun way. It's not perfect since there are some semi-annoying things in it, I'm just happy Disney made something super unique.  The voice acting is really solid, and I recognized quite a bit of them like Joseph Gordon-Levitt, Martin Short, Emma Thompson, and Michael Wincott. The characters are mostly really good, but for me, John Silver might be one of the most complex characters in Disney history. He's an antagonist for most of this film, but he has a really good heart and is a sort of surrogate father figure to Jim Hawkins. I really loved his character development, and he really was the strongest character in the whole film for me. The only characters that kind of made me annoyed was B.E.N. and Morph, while I think Martin Short is hilarious, he just was used way too much and I didn't really care that much about Morph.  The score by James Newton Howard is absolutely incredible, and I can't help but love the use of that 2000s pop rock. Especially “I'm Still Here (Jim's Theme)”, what a track! The use of CGI and 2D animated, while a bit dated, paints this imaginative world well. But there are times where CGI pops in, and it's super jarring. The writing is fine, but the relationship between Jim Hawkins and John Silver holds this film together. I love the use of orange and blue coloring in this, it's super ethereal and wonderful. The pacing was decent, but I felt some of the humor didn't land for me. Lastly, the third act is very bombastic and visually astonishing, but I just felt like there needed to be a bit more. It just felt a tiny bit underwhelming.  But overall, this was definitely a pleasant experience. Glad I got to see it.  What did you guys think about this film?"

I mean cmon...in 2006 he was a depressed teenager with very little diologue in Little Miss Sunshine and 1 year later worked alongside DDL in There will be Blood and absolutely held his own with one of the greatest ever? That's a feat very few could do.  Second is Travis Fimmel. This man was a damn underwear model....AN UNDERWEAR MODEL. I have no idea how he nailed the lead role in Vikings, but anyone who has watched the show will tell you how good he is. I've been watching film for 31 years and I can confidently say Travis's performance in the show was some of the greatest acting I've ever seen in cinema.

As a Bay film, I basically had zero expectations and the mixed reviews didn't do nothing to help that. Still I gave it a try , and was totally surprised at how I ended up liking it. Not a perfect film but liked the performances, action scenes and basically it was entertaining.   Another one was The Lost City. Maybe it's cuz of Brad Pitt's cameo, I ended up loving it, more than I thought I would. Felt different from the more CGI filled blockbusters of the modern era.

And after watching it, all three and a half hours of it, I am convinced that it is a massive troll campaign.  Gut Opinion: Why would I want to see a woman peeling potatoes on film in real time  when I can watch a woman peeling potatoes at home?  Nothing happens in the movie. It is not ellipsis or exaggeration, absolutely nothing happens. It is a woman doing her daily life in real time. Seeing her wash the dishes, cook, eat with her son, go shopping, the only thing that comes out of the ordinary is that she does sex work, but that's part of that routine.  There is no conflict except in the last twenty minutes, the woman must find a button for her son's jacket that was sent to her by her aunt who lives in Canada.  And here is the big problem; there is no stylization; i.e, reality is not filtered or paraphrased, there is no work of mimesis, it is unaltered daily life, there is an ellipsis of time, if it didn't, the film would last seventy-two hours, but it pretends not to, by showing the actions in real time.  The second is ; in other slow and boring films the actions are loaded, that is, there is a great purpose, they are directed towards an end, that is why we put up with them. Here, they do not have that end. It is the absolute ennui.  And what is more French than that?  On the second day things go wrong, the coffee does not taste good and the woman prepares it again, but there is no reason for it, there is a whole level of inner life that is completely alien to us, we do not know the reason for the action in the literally last eighth minute, and in the last seven minutes the woman is just sitting at the dining room table.  The only extraordinary action, which would have any kind of impact on her life from that moment on, just happens.  Jeanne Dielman, 23 quai du Commerce, 1080 Bruxelles cannot be the greatest movie of all time because it lacks two things that every movie should have; stylization and conflict.  The message of the panel that gave it such a distinction is that the best story that cinema can tell is none, it is to be a mere portrait of reality, without altering, without commenting, without stylizing, without glamorizing, without editing. And as such, any interpretation or allegory is valid because the film is like a cloud. When you are doing a daily and repetitive action your mind wanders off. Any comment or review, then, will not be about the film itself, but about the person who tells you about it and their idiosyncrasy.  &#x200B;  If you want to see feminism, it will be there because you brought it.   I am aware that by writing this I am telling you something about myself. and that is the artistic intention.   But I think the purpose of cinema is telling stories and take us to the realm of the extra-ordinary.  If I wanted ordinary I have a lot of it at home."

Even if you're against the idea of a sequel... we all know shameless sequels get made regardless( Kindergarten Cop 2). So I'm surprised Phone Booth has gone untouched. Especially considering the similarities it shares with Saw; both take place in few locations, both feature an unseen killer playing games with the protagonist, and both have a twist ending where the killer gets away.   Personally, I think sequels for this film COULD work. Maybe following along with Saw; have multiple victims in phone booths at one time who have to work together. Maybe have a 'Phone Booth Game' akin to Dirty Harry. Heck, maybe evolve it to a mobile phone or something in later sequels. I think the killer was interesting enough to carry a few more movies."

Given that the failure of Sergei Bondarchuk's *Waterloo* (1970) (which is a great film, nonetheless) was one of the catalysts of Kubricks original project being cancelled, do you think there is any possibility of this getting made after Scott's upcoming *Napoleon* (especially if it turns out to be a success)?  Also, on a similar note, Scott's *Napoleon* is the first such historical epic about him in years. If this does turn out to be widely successful (ignoring the lukewarm response to his *Last Duel*), do you think it will lead to another cycle of historical epics?  &#x200B;  EDIT: Thanks for the comments. I was thinking more about a possible revival of the project, perhaps in the form of the long mooted HBO series.  Obviously, it won't correspond exactly to Kubrick's original intention (especially the spectacle side of things - e.g. battle sequences -  which would most likely need a lot of CGI), but at least the project will have technically been made in a sense. Plus, given the Napoleonic era is so history-rich, a miniseries is probably the better option if you want to show his entire life and not cut too much out.  Regarding Kubrick's intended vision, I'd imagine any potential director would need to get the family's approval, etc. around certain things (let alone viewing the existing material), so the final product might not be too bad if things go well."

        "body": "I just finished watching Robert Eggers' *The Lighthouse* and I was blown away. One thing that stood out to me was the characters referring to one another as dog or in other canine ways. Throughout the first two acts, there are multiple instances where Thomas Wake refers to Thomas Howard/Ephraim Winslow as a dog. The first mention is when Wake asserts his power to Howard, telling Howard that he'll do whatever he tells him to and he'll like it cuz I says you will! Contradict me again, and I'll dock your wages. Swab, dog, swab. Later, Howard reveals to Wake that when he was working as a logger that goddamned Canady bastard \\[the real Ephraim Winslow\\] always called me a dog. A filthy dog. I'll show you a dog. I'll show you whose a dog. This anecdote makes it clear to the audience, and evidently to Wake, that this term gets under Howard's skin. The term represents the power other people exert onto Howard, a man who yearns for the day he can be free from obligation and dependence. Later, when Howard recounts the death of the real Ephraim Winslow, we remarks that the last thing he yelled to him was Tom, you dog! During one of the film's major turning points when Wake confronts Howard about killing the gull and Howard denies it, Wake shouts that he is a murdering dog! Twas what changed the wind on us. Twas ye what damned us, dog. Twas ye! Moments later, Wakes continues his verbal assault, telling Howard that Winslow were right! Thomas, ye're a dog! A filthy dog! A dog! It is upon the delivery of this line that Pattinson's character lunges at Dafoe's, sending them sprawling onto the wooden floor. After Howard leaves Wake in a huddled in pain on the floor, he stands directly over him and commands him to bark like a dog. Bark, boy, bark Howard insists. After a pause, Wake's meager woof marks what I believe to be the final stage of the shift in power dynamic between the two men. Whatsmore, after Wake's woofing, Howard asks him whose a good boy and to roll over in the same way a dog-owner would speak to their canine. What follows is an extreme, but powerful representation of just how drastically the power has shifted in Howard's favor. As he walks into the foreground, we see his is holding a rope lead on the end of which is Wake crawling on all fours like a dog. Here, Eggers makes no attempt at subtlety to convey the power Howard seems to wield in the two men's relationship. No longer is he the one being treated like a dog as if he is less than human. Now he is the one who holds the leash and dictates the other man, both literally and metaphorically. Notably, the raging tempest that dominates the film after Howard kills the gull seems to have completely dissipated. Pointing to the empty pit at the base of the lighthouse, he orders  Wake to get in there; where you belong. You do as I say, dog. Howard proceeds to shovel direct on top the old wickie. Now it was at this moment in the film that I expected Wake to break. I expected an increasingly tearful scene where Wake begs to be spared while Howard basks in the victory of literally burying the only obstacle that stands between him and the light. But as heaps of dirt are stacked onto his beaten body, Wake does not fuss nor cry. Instead, he is remarkably calm and seems to taunt Howard, asking his if he wishes to see what's in the lantern? before delivering one of the film's most memorable monologues in which he laments about what Protean forms swim up from men's mind and melt into hot Promethean plunder, scorching eyes and divine shames and horror and casting them down into Davy Jones. The others, still blind, yet in it see all the divine graces ... Them's truth. You'll be punished.  &#x200B;  I am wondering what you all think about the significance of dog name calling and references throughout the film? Is it used by Eggers to portray the rapid shift in the two men's power dynamic? What does it say about Thomas Howard's struggle to assert his identity? Based on Wake's calm demeanor and ominous monologue as Howard buries him, do you think there was a shift in power to begin with or does it just appear that way to Howard because he is the one who now holds the leash? Did Wake know that Howard was doomed from the beginning and will inevitably succumb to the fatal truth that awaits him atop the lighthouse? Does the light represent truth, which is why it kills Howard - a man averse to the truth?"

        "body": "Just some preamble. I'm an American, so maybe that's where most of my gripes come from. Although this movie is Icelandic, I believe, it's set in modern times, and although they live in the countryside, there is reason to believe, there is a metro/City area nearby so yeah. So I'm fully aware of any culture barriers, but I just dubunked them, so yeah. There are a few other posts on Reddit, discussing this movie, but not many. This post will contain spoilers, if you haven't seen it yet.  I first heard about Lamb, through one of those text to speech film recap channels on YouTube. (Which I hate, as they spoil the movie in the title, and spoil the movie in the recap video. Lol. They are also very viral, these types of videos. I can't stand it. Lol.) I had to stop watching the recap, to avoid being spoiled, and just add the film to my watchlist. The plot seemed interesting, as I like more morbid twisted psych thriller/horror stories. Etc. I finally rented it online this weekend. I was so disappointed, and I feel the film was very bad, and made no sense.  Assuming you all have seen the film, and know the plot. There are several avenues which list the sypnosis online. Because I'm just going to generalize, from this point forward. It's about a couple, Ingvar, and Maria, who have this large farm property in Iceland, where their home is adjacent to their farm business. One of their sheep, give birth to a half sheep, half human, hybrid offspring. They name her Ada, and raise her like a human child. Ingvar's brother Petur, later moves in with them.   First the good, and what I liked.  I loved the cinematography. I loved the location, their house, the farming business aesthetic. I loved how a lot of modern technology references were used (Petur shocked they still have VHS tapes in their living room). I liked the CGI they used for Ada. I liked how based on the production side of things, I felt I was at their farm/barn etc. So yeah.  Now onto what I didn't like.  I don't like how this is a movie, where you have to assume, and guess everything.  Ingvar and Maria, who are, Husband and Wife, farmers, help Ada's mother/the pregnant Lamb, we saw in the first scene staggering into the barn. However we see expressions of concerns on their faces, but we dont know what Ada's condition, or appearance is. We later find out, deep into the film, the lower portion of her body is human female, but the upper part, her head, arms, chest, are Lamb/sheep etc. Very confusing.  Ingvar and Maria immediately decide to adopt Ada as their daughter. (Which I understand they had a miscarriage earlier, but still) With no discussion of calling the news, no awkward phase. Both of them thinking a lamb/human hybrid is normal etc. Very perplexing.  Ada runs away several times. You think they would lock their front door, or put a leash on her. Hated how every other scene, Ingvar or Maria are in haste, as Ada ran out the house again.  Ingvar's brother Petur, is introduced, in a confusing way. You see a bunch of guys throw his wallet and phone into the wilderness, and kick him out the car. Is he in a secret mafia group? Is he a musician? Until Ingvar said Ada, this is Uncle Petur, I had suspicions he was his Brother, but we could only assume  All we know is Maria had an affair with him at one point. Feel this could have been better setup. Lol.  Maria kills Ada's mother, because she constantly pesters and follows, Ingvar and Maria, as she's depressed, they took her baby away, of course. Don't like how they wouldnt let her interact with Ada still. Etc.   Petur's reaction to Ada, is simply literally only, The fuck, and yet, he accepts Ada, and has a good relationship with her. He doesn't immediately run to the press, or city to reveal this secret? Yeah right.   Ada ages and grows up, at least a couple of years, by the time Petur moves in. So Ingvar and Maria's plan, was to always keep her hidden? Ada wears little girl human clothes. She has really good cognitive abilities. She can do chores around the house. She eats human food. She can watch TV, and dance. She is constantly cuddling either Ingvar, Maria, or Petur. She understands Icelandic. Etc. What about school for Ada. What about putting her on Iceland Got Talent etc. How long did they expect this secret gig to go on?  The really gross, uneeded, and out of place, sex scene between Ingvar and Maria, which was parallel edited to Petur and Ada downstairs in the living room, dancing and watching the music video channel on TV, was so cringe.   Petur tries to seduce Maria. She rejects his advances, and Peter just leaves in acceptance amicably. Keeping the Ada secret. Okay. Lol.   Climax ending scene. Igvar while out doing field work with Ada helping him, is shot and killed, by a half ram, half human like man, we assume is Ada's father. He also kills their dog for no reason. Smh. But I assumed it would have had to been a more human looking being, to be the father. The ram looked way too feral, and didnt have much humanoid features, unless he can shape shift, and we don't know. The ram drops the gun, and carries Ada away. Maria appears later, and is in total confusion. The end. No more explanations. Lol.  Feel this movie although cinema wise, was okay, just story wise. It wasn't that good. I feel maybe if this story were set in America, Ada would have been a reality star, and it would have been a different setup. Seems for no reason, the couple has no direction or plan for her. Petur/Uncle appears, and acts like Ada is a dog/cat, and doesn't feel creeped out, or intrigued. He's just whatever about it. Petur leaves on happy terms. Ada's assumed father is perturbed, and takes her away, killing Ingvar. Maria is just left with so many unanswered thoughts and questions. That's it. I don't know man. Smh. Lol.  Strange movie, but those are my gripes with it. Leave any comments please, if you guys agree/disagree. Thank you. :)"

Tom Hanks does a stellar job of playing a stranded traveler who speaks little English and has to navigate the challenges of living in an airport terminal. I especially appreciate the way it displays the powers of having your priorities straight, a fitting holiday message."

So looking back over the Oscar award for Best Original Score I was pretty shocked that they both lost. Inception lost to The Social Network and Interstellar lost to The Grand Budapest Hotel. Both The Social Network and Grand Budapest have great soundtracks but they aren't as memorable.   Hans Zimmer felt like he was innovating with these two scores. Inception using a big orchestra of Brass players to emphasize the notion of time slowing down and making the score sound even more epic. Which went on to be copied A LOT. Then Interstellar utilizing a vast array of organ pipes and also incorporating the notion of a ticking clock into the soundtrack to subconsciously instill a sense of anxiety into the audience. Most of the score was so emotionally charged that it felt like it linked together Cooper and Murph, despite them being galaxies apart. Along with most of the tracks within these two scores being bangers. Like No Time for Caution or a random chase scene in Inception having the best chase music ever called Mombasa.  When you compare these two soundtracks to The Social Network and Grand Budapest it surprises me who ended up winning. Between the two though maybe Grand Budapest would have a chance, but still."

She plays an incredibly unlikable and selfish person who just barely manages to get past each obstacle in her way and you're just barely rooting for her too.  Some of the plot points are a bit contrived/convenient and the child actor isn't the best, but it moves along at a really good pace and Tilda Swinton is just so damn entertaining and unpredictable in her performance.

My aunt was the one watching, I really didn't want to as the little girl in it creeped me out, and she is the only real thing I remember from it.   – She wore a wig, and a mask. I believe she also wore a dress, with stockings, and dress shoes, but that part is vague at best.   – When it was revealed that she was burned, her father informed the 'guests' that it as punishment for being a bad girl.   – She never really spoke, but squealed when expressing her dissatisfaction.   – in the movie she appeared to be really sweet, but still gave the guests a weird vibe.   – she liked to sit on her dad's lap at the head of the table   Considering the info I remember, I can only assume it was a horror of some type, but as I stated before I was just a kid. It could have just seemed like a horror to me at the time. I don't remember the plot, a single other character, or actors/actresses that acted in it.  NOTE. It is not Les yeux sans visage (1960)."

        "body": "What big movie stars do you know of who mostly do bad or forgettable movies?  To kick this off, the one that comes to mind for me is Ryan Reynolds.  Now, don't get me wrong, I am not saying he does only bad or forgettable movies, but I am saying that he mostly does.  Obviously, we have his stand out hit/franchise Deadpool.  It seems that since Ryan Reynolds became a big star, his name was always attached to this character, and it was essentially handed to him on a plate, and he didn't disappointed.  He is perfect for the role.  The handling of the character was bad in his first outing (Wolverine), but since then it has been handled great.  He will forever be attached to Deadpool and that will keep him elevated as a big star and he'll likely never needs to work again if he so wishes.  But, most of his list of work just isn't great, with some minor exceptions.  Safe House was amazing.  It was very much in the same mould as the Jason Bourne action thrillers, but it worked on it's own.  More recently, Free Guy was a huge hit for Ryan Reynolds too.  I loved Buried, but many did not.  I am not too fond of the Hitman's Bodyguard myself, but I think audiences did respond well.  Despite these few exceptions, I just feel he is very bad at choosing roles.  Some of his films are very weird (not in a good way), and downbeat, and lifeless.  I don't know how else to explain them.    Another name that comes to mind is Chris Hemsworth.  Again, don't get me wrong, he of course has Thor behind him, as well as other related MCU movies (Thor to Hemsworth is much like Deadpool to Reynolds), but he has a long long list of utterly forgettable bad movies that just don't work in any way.  Again, with a few exceptions here and there, I feel he is very bad at choosing projects.  Do you agree with what I've said?  Do you have any other actors in mind who mostly do bad movies?  EDIT:  Related question:  what is the deal with Ryan Reynolds taking smaller roles in other people's movies?  The most recent example is in Hobbs and Shaw for all of two minutes.  Bullet Train.  Ted.  Life.  Criminal.  A Million Ways To Die In The West.  The list goes on."

        "body": "In the world of cinema, lighting is often an overlooked but essential element that can greatly enhance a film's visual aesthetic and help tell its story more effectively. One such example is the 1972 classic, The Godfather.  Directed by Francis Ford Coppola, The Godfather is a crime drama that follows the rise of the Corleone family, one of New York's most powerful mafia clans. The film is known for its complex characters, dramatic plot twists, and stunning visuals, and the lighting plays a key role in creating its mood and atmosphere.  One of the standout aspects of the lighting in The Godfather is its use of contrast. The film often features dark, shadowy scenes that create a sense of mystery and danger, while also highlighting the characters' emotions and inner turmoil. This is particularly evident in the famous scene where Michael Corleone (played by Al Pacino) kills a rival mafia boss in a dimly lit restaurant.  But the lighting in The Godfather is not just about creating a mood - it also helps to establish the film's setting and time period. The film is set in the 1940s and 1950s, and the lighting plays a crucial role in conveying this through its use of warm, golden tones and soft, diffused light. This gives the film a timeless, nostalgic quality that helps transport viewers to the world of the Corleone family.  Overall, the lighting in The Godfather is an integral part of the film's success. It adds depth and dimension to the story, and helps to create a rich, immersive experience for viewers. It's a prime example of how effective lighting can elevate a film from good to great."

        "body": "Watching this 100+ times this year with my son has had me analyzing everything in it. Every piece of foreground and background art and the themes and stories and characters have been thought about more then anyone should.  But overtime I've realized a few things. That Andy and Sid's fathers aren't present in the movie. In an interview Andy's dad has passed away is why he isn't there according to the writers. Sid's family seems more like his father and mother divorced or he was never there.   Why do I bring this up? Because I've decided that the movie is actually a comparison for how these two kids treat their toys and the people in their lives without a father figure to guide either of them. We see Sid being bad always, tortures toys, tortures his sister, and does whatever he wants. He was at Pizza Planet alone and road his skateboard him alone at night. Also he order a large firework rocket that explicitly says keep out of reach of children. Andy's mom brought him to Pizza Planet unlike Sid's mom. Then Sid asks his mom for matches and says never I got them and she never comes to see what he's burning or raises concern to stop him. This is showing how the nurture aspect has been so different for them. That Andy's mom is trying to make it okay for her son without the father there. And Sid's mom isn't really present, my assumption is from depression from her whole situation.  The reason why the story focuses on the toys instead mostly is because they were easier to animate at the time since everything looked like plastic so they decided to animate things that should be plastic. Then they just use the lives of the toys and how they feel about the kids to further build on the hidden underlying theme.  Have I seen this too many times? Yes. Please send help. If you'd like to discuss this more then let's see what you think. Have a great day with the kiddos everyone."

        "body": "I'll start by saying that Kirsten Dunst is not a bad actress. She's passable as a performer, but in every movie, I've seen her in, she blends into the film like wallpaper. Nothing stands out about her. The closest was maybe The Virgin Suicides (1999), but then again that had a very good script.   Her skyrocket to fame was obviously Spiderman (2002). Despite the cringe romance of the film and the awkward editing here and there, the film was a massive financial success. It essentially launched the superhero movie genre into the stratosphere. It doesn't change the fact that someone that average has been able to be that successful. She must have an amazing agent."

        "body": "I'm not the biggest Shane Black fan but this I liked. Might be his best. It's really funny but it also has an impressively intricate noir story. And I like the LA setting. They really use it to their advantage, kinda like Collateral.  Solid performances too. RDJ is firmly in Tony Stark mode here and seeing him do that in a different kind of movie was fun. And this might actually be my favorite Val Kilmer performance. His acerbic delivery is spot on but I actually kinda bought him as a detective too. I thought Michelle Monaghan overcooked it a few times with the drama and overacting, but not by much, and it does kind of work for the tone they're going for.  I will say, I did really like the narration, and it's necessary to complete the homage to 50s noir he's doing here, but I think Shane Black uses it as a crutch a couple times.   There's a few moments where Harry acknowledges that something is a plothole or a cliché, and that meta acknowledgment through narration is meant to hand wave any issues. It was funny, but it did also feel like a bit of a cheap way to quickly write yourself out of any corner.  But yeah, overall it's funny, the story's interesting, and even though it's not an action movie, the few scenes of it that are there are well-filmed. Particularly the climax on the bridge I thought was quite cool."

Quintessential Christmas movie!” but I have a list of movies/tv episodes/ specials I watch everyday until Christmas, and tonight is Miracle on 34th Street, and I'm kind of not looking forward to it. I don't really find the movie that jolly, it doesn't lift my spirits like a holiday movie should, it doesn't really feel Christmasy, they literally hint at Chris not actually being Santa and just a crazy old man. So far I've watched It's A Wonderful Life, Arthur Christmas, and 8 Bit Christmas and those have really gotten me in the spirit but Miracle on 34th Street? Nope.  What are yours?"

One would think the movies would be a great way to gain new eyes to the shows, and I don't see why the actors wouldn't want that box office paycheck.  The soap opera 'Days of our Lives' has been around since 1965 and is *still* going  'The Young and the Restless' has been going since 1973  'As the World Turns' went on from 1956 to 2010, that's 54 straight years of a TV show that never got a theatrical treatment  It just blows my mind that none of the big soap opera franchises ever thought to tackle the big screen"
